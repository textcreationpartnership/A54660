            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THough this Epistle (a part whereof is ſpoken to in the enſuing Treatiſe) was directly and expreſly ſent to the Angel and Church in <hi>Laodicea;</hi> yet it alſo (as well as the reſt of the Meſſages, or Epiſtles) was ſpoken by the holy Spirit unto the Churches in general; and therefore, every one <hi>that hath an ear</hi> is exhorted and called upon <hi>to hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> Rev. 3.
22. And it is therefore of concernment for others, for all that have received the Word of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christ, to mind and conſider what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and faulted in this Angel and Church; what is threatned to them; and the counſel given by the <hi>Amen,</hi> to cure their diſtemper, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the judgement.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103338:3"/> It is poſſible that other Angels and Churches, and particular perſons, who have formerly been called to the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and who have received the word of God, as it is in truth the word of God, may alſo ſuffer a decay of thoſe things that have been wrought in them by the glorious Goſpel, and grow remiſs, heartleſs, and indifferent, as it fared with this Angel and Church, and as our Saviour hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, <hi>that becauſe iniquity ſhould abound, the love of many would wax cold.</hi> Matt. <hi>24. 12.</hi> And eſpecially toward the time of the end he hath foretold us there would be a generall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuch as are of his Churches and people, in ſuch as profeſs to wait for and attend his coming, as he ſignifieth in that parable of his mentioned. <hi>Matt. 25. 1-5.</hi> In which he ſaith, not as in many other Parables, <hi>The kingdom of Heaven is like,</hi> &amp;c. But, <hi>Then ſhall the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be likened</hi> (by thoſe therein) <hi>unto Ten Virgins,—which went forth to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom—And while the Bridegroom tarried they all ſlumbred and ſlept:</hi> They did not with zeal and fervency hear Chriſt, watching daily at at his Gates, waiting at the posts of his doors, that they might find him, as his grace inſtructeth, and
<pb facs="tcp:103338:3"/> is operating in thoſe that have it, and yield up themſelves to it. <hi>Prov. 8. 34. 35.</hi> But in too great a meaſure were grown ſlothful, heartleſs, and ſecure: And ſurely this is written and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our admonition and warning, upon whom the ends of the world are come, to the intent we might give ſuch earnest and diligent heed to the things we have heard, the word of Chriſt, which is as a fire, that our hearts might burn within us, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with love to him, and filled with ſuch an high prizing of him, and the unſearchable riches of him, as to ſell and forgo all we have for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of him and them, that we may gain him, and be found in him. <hi>Luk. 24. 26, 27, 32. Jer. 23. 29.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then that it is poſſible, and may ſo come to paſs, that others, yea any who have received the grace of God, may become Lukewarm, and neither hot, nor cold, and may go backward and not forward. <hi>Jer. 7.
24.</hi> If they abid not in Chriſt Jeſus as they have received him; it is good and needful for us all to examine our ſelves in the light of the Lord, and ſearch our hearts and ways, that we may ſee and diſcern what manner of perſons we are; and what diſcovery the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt maketh of us: Let us not reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb facs="tcp:103338:4"/> in any good thoughts we may have of our ſelves;
<hi>For, not he that commendeth himſelf is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>10. 18.</hi> Nor let us conclude that we are in a good condition, becauſe others may think well, and ſpeak highly of us, that are our brethren and companions, for a man may have a name among the Churches
<hi>that he liveth, and yet be dead.</hi> Rev. <hi>

But let every man prove, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his own work, and then ſhall he have his rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> not in another's good thought or opinion of him. <hi>Gal. 6. 4.</hi> We may have run well in former times, we may have run from all our own things unto Chriſt, and followed him through good report, and bad report; and yet now be letted and hindered from that fervent demeanour and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our ſelves. <hi>Gal. 5. 7, 8.</hi> We may have been called unto Chriſt, and called according to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and yet again be removed from him that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us into the grace of Chriſt. <hi>Gal. 1. 6.</hi> We may have gone after him in the Wilderneſs, as it were, and yet now go far from him, and walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vanity, and become vain, and ſo grieve him, and his good ſpirit, by whom we have been called to the knowledge of the truth. <hi>Jer.

            <p>And be we well aſſured of this, that if once we entertain, and retain ſuch high and unſober thoughts of our ſelves, and of our attainments and injoyments, as to ſay, <hi>We are rich, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> and ſo ſhut the door upon and against Chriſt Jeſus; and ſuffer him to stand and knock thereas; we ſhall but deceive our ſelves, if we imagine we are free from this nauſeous diſtemper; we may then be confident that blindneſs hath happened to us in ſome, yea in a great meaſure; and may upon ſure grounds judge and conclude our ſelves to be like to this Angel and Church, and fear he will deal with
<pb facs="tcp:103338:5"/> us as he threatneth to do to theſe, if we continue and perſist in our high thoughts of our ſelves; <hi>For Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Spirit before a fall.</hi> Prov. 16. 18. He will ſave the afflicted humbled people, thoſe who are poor in ſpirit, who have nothing to glory in before God, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>But his eyes are upon the haughty, that he may bring them down.
2</hi> Som. 22. 28. 1 Cor. 1. 29-31. Oh! Let us not lift up our ſelves in our doings, knowledge, attainments; for we have cauſe ſufficient to take ſhame to our ſelves that we are ſo barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: Nor let us think our ſelves, or others to be any whit the better becauſe of our thinking, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly of our ſelves; but rather ſuſpect our ſelves, and know, that this is an evidence, and cauſe of our Lukewarmneſs: <hi>We may ſay,</hi> the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are we, and yet ſteal from, and defraud others, and commit adultery, <hi>&amp;c. Jer.
7. 4-10.</hi> We may boaſt that our hearts are right, and cry, <hi>come ſee my zeal for the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and depart from, and deſtroy inferiour I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and yet ſerve Golden ones. <hi>2 Kings 10. 15,
<pb facs="tcp:103338:5"/> 16, 25. 29.</hi> We may ſpeak one to another, and ſay, come I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth out of the mouth of the Lord; and may come unto his Servants and Prophets as the people cometh, and ſit before them as God's people, and hear his words; and the word of his ſervants may be unto us as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument; and yet we may not do what we hear, but our hearts may go after our covetouſneſs. <hi>Ezek. 33.
30-32.</hi> We may come into God's preſence, and ſtand and pray with our ſelves. (as being ſo holy that others may not come near us) God, <hi>We thank thee we are not like other men;</hi> and yet thoſe we ſeparate from, may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified rather then we. <hi>Luk. 18. 11-14.</hi> We may know we have knowledge, <hi>and yet know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as we ought to know. 1</hi> Cor. 8. 1-3. We may boast that we are rich, and full; and yet be ſo carnal that God's ſervants cannot ſpeak to us as unto ſpiritual ones. 1 Cor. 4. 8. with chap. 3. 1-5. We may bestow all our goods to feed the poor, and give our bodies to be burned, and yet not have charity, and ſo it may profit us nothing. 1 Cor. 13. 3. We may plead that we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in Christ's name, and in his name have coſt
<pb facs="tcp:103338:6"/> out Devils, and in his name done many wonderful works; and yet not be built upon the rock, which is Chriſt, and ſo be rejected in concluſion. <hi>Matt. 7. 22-27.</hi> We may glory in our building of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for God, and yet forget our maker; and count the great things of his Law ſtrange things to us. <hi>Iſa 66. 1, 2, 3. Hoſ 8. 12-14.</hi> Oh! take we heed of ſeeking our own glory, or boasting of our ſelves, or of any of our own things before him; though we may be in any meaſure perfect, or ſo graciouſly reputed, yet let us not know our own ſouls thereby. <hi>Job 9.
20, 21.</hi> Though we be righteous, yet let us not lift up our heads. <hi>Job
10. 15.</hi> Though we know nothing by our ſelves, yet know we, we are not thereby juſtified. <hi>1 Cor. 4. 4.</hi> And be we well aſſured, that when we cry we are full, and come not continually unto Christ as the onely foundation of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fountain of grace and truth, bread of life, god tried in the fire, robe of righteouſneſs; great and fundamental

            <p>Becauſe by their office and furniture they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the myſteries of God; and it is required of them that they be found faithful in communicating to others, what is given and imparted to them for their good, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1, 2.

               <hi>Verſ. 15. I know thy works,]</hi> By <hi>[knowing]</hi> here, is not only meant, a ſeeing and underſtanding what they were, and of what nature; for ſo he ſeeth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>all</hi> things.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 17. Nor at all an owning and approving them: Indeed the word
<hi>[know]</hi> doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſignify, approve, <hi>as,</hi> the Lord
<hi>knoweth</hi> the way of the righteous; he owneth it, and will preſerve it for ever, as oppoſed to the periſhing of the way of the ungodly.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 6. And ſo the Lord <hi>knoweth</hi> them that are his, that come unto, and abide upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. So 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 3. Joh.</hi> 10. 27. But in this ſenſe, he did not know their works,

            <p>2. But hereby <hi>[know]</hi> is meant, I take notice off, and wiſtly obſerve thy works; I conſider them, and the nature and quality of them: In this ſenſe it is often to be taken both as with reſpect to God and men: So with reſpect to God, and by him it is ſaid, <hi>Hoſ. 13. 5. I did know thee in the Wilderneſs;</hi> namely, he did then take notice of them, to provide for them, and take care of them; and rebuke and chaſten them as need was: So the Pſalmiſt, it ſeemeth, uſeth <hi>conſidering,</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as words of a like ſignification, when he ſaith, thou haſt <hi>conſidered</hi> my trouble, thou haſt <hi>known</hi> my ſoul in adverſities. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7. So with reſpect to men, As, not knowing (minding, conſidering, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice) that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. So it is uſed in this ſenſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of every of the meſſages to the Churches: And in that he ſaith, <hi>I know,</hi> I take notice of thy works, he ſignifieth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he doth not paſs ſentence upon men, or their works, he doth not approve, or reprove, till firſt he conſidereth their works; he taketh notice of them, and pondereth all their goings, before he juſtifieth, or condemneth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 21. Hence in every of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to the Seven Churches, after he directeth them, and giveth a deſcription of himſelf, he firſt ſaith, <hi>I know thy works, Rev. 2.
2, 9, 13, 19. chap. 3. 1, 8, 15. The Lord is a God of judgment, and by him Actions are weighed. 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 3. So when the cry of <hi>Sodom</hi> was great, and their ſin grievous, he ſaith, <hi>I will go down now, and ſee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me, and if not I will know,</hi> Gen. 18. 21. <hi>He is excellent in power, and in judgment,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103338:16"/> and in plenty of juſtice, he will not afflict; men do therefore fear him. Job</hi> 37. 23, 24. And this is for inſtruction to us, that we ſhould not reprove, or fault another, till we conſider what his works are, and know and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that they are ſuch as are condemnable by the light of the glorious Goſpel; but to be imitatours of Chriſt Jeſus according to the inſtructions of his Grace,—</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> he ſignifieth his love to us, and care of us; ſuch is his love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us that he conſidereth our works, that if they be not perfect before him, and in his ſight, he may rebuke us, and not ſuffer ſin upon us.
<hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. So great is his charity towards us that he covereth our ſins, ſo as to ſeek and purſue our good; and ſuch is his charity, that it leadeth him to take notice of our works, that when need is he may reprove us; and ſanctify, and cleanſe us with the waſhing of water by the word. So when he declareth his love and faithfulneſs towards
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I have been a rebuker of them all;</hi> and addeth, <hi>I know, I take notice of Ephraim, and Iſrael is not hid from me:—They will not frame their doings to turn unto the Lord.</hi> Hoſ.
5. 2, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He herein gives us to underſtand whoſe works he knoweth eſpecially, and taketh notice of; I know <hi>[thy]</hi> works; their works that have had means and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. He knoweth not, in this ſenſe mens works, till he preventeth them with his goodneſs; he looketh not to gather Grapes of Thornes, nor Figs of Thiſtles; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in us, as of us dwelleth no good thing; and that our works muſt needs be evil, and unprofitable before his Grace bringeth ſalvation to men, as it doth to
<hi>all</hi> men in due time. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11. But when he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103338:16"/> ſome means, and afforded ſome light to men, then he looketh down from Heaven to ſee if there be any that underſtand, and ſeek after God. <hi>Pſal. 14. 2. He faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mens hearts alike,</hi> and (then) <hi>he conſidereth all their works. Pſal.</hi> 33. 15. But eſpecially when men are brought unto, and planted in his Vineyard, then he pondereth what their doings are: He expecteth that there ſhould be ſome return from them ſuitable to the means uſed, pains taken, and care exerciſed towards and about them. So he ſaith, for inſtruction to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Behold</hi> (mind this well, and give attention to it) <hi>theſe three years I come ſeeking Fruit of this Fig-tree. Luk.</hi> 13. 7. So when he telleth us what he had done to his Vineyard, <hi>that he fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted it with the choiceſt Vine, and built a Towre in the midſt of it, and alſo made a Wine-preſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> he addeth, <hi>and he looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes. Iſa.</hi> 5. 1. 2. <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 33, 37. He taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them eſpecially, whether there be with them the work of faith, and labour of love; he expecteth that that earth which is ſo incloſed, and ordered; and which drinketh in the rain that oft cometh upon it, ſhould bring forth herbs meet for him by whom it is dreſſed, even the work and labour of love, that it may receive further bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 10. His eye is continually upon his Church and Churches, as to preſerve, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from evil, and to diſpence to them whatever may fit them for fruitfulneſs before him, that they may ſhew forth his praiſes who hath called them out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into his marvellous light: So to obſerve what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion his Grace hath upon them, how it is received by them, and what it produceth in them; or whether it be received in vain;
<hi>That ſo he may rebuke and chaſten
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103338:17"/> them, as he doth, as many as he loveth.</hi> Rev. 3. 19. <hi>You only,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore will I puniſh you for all your tranſgreſsions.

            <p n="1">1.

So he here threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he will ſpue them out of his mouth, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he may have ſo done with this Church long ſince: <hi>Thou</hi> Capernaum, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We are not <hi>Cold,</hi> we read, hear, pray in our families, frequent Aſſemblies, uſe the Ordinances of Chriſt, and are called by his Name; they are ready to thank God they are not like other men, or like to what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſometimes were, and not onely juſtifie themſelves herewith before men, but indeavour ſo to do before God alſo; they not only weary men but God alſo with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and pleading for themſelves, and take it ill at his hands, and are even angry that he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and hear their Prayers, and grant their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. So when the Lord ſent the Prophet to reprove his people, he acquainteth and telleth them they were not <hi>Cold,</hi> and that they had this to plead for themſelves, and excuſe themſelves withall, that they might ſtill hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to return; and becauſe hereby they were blunt, and unapt to receive correction, and to turn at reproof, therefore the Prophet is charged to put to the more ſtrength. <hi>Cry aloud, ſaith the Lord, (for</hi>

               </gap>ched, as if it were a doctrine of profaneneſs! How is God's name hereby polluted? Hence the Lord as one highly diſpleaſed and provoked, thus ſpeaketh to his people in former times, who did not ſervently and ſincerely ſeek and ſerve him: <hi>As for you, O houſe of Iſrael, thus ſaith the Lord God, go ye, ſerve ye every one his own idols, and hereafter alſo if ye will not hearken to me,</hi> (to obey my voice, and give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my name) <hi>but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your ſacrifices.

As if he ſhould ſay, you had better be quite cold then thus lukewarm; did you wholly follow after your idols, and make no profeſſion of ſerving me, my name would not be ſo greatly polluted as now it is, while you call upon me, and yet ſerve your own idols. Oh! this tendeth very much to the blemiſhing of God's worthy name called upon us, and to the defiling God's ſanctuary, when perſons are ſerving their idols, and ſowing to the fleſh, and yet come the ſame day into his Sanctuary, and appear to take delight in approching to him, as if they were delivered to do thoſe abominations; or as if the grace of God heard, and in ſome ſort received by them, gave them incouragement to ſerve ſin, or follow their vanities, from which indeed it cometh to redeem them, and to that purpoſe bringeth ſalvation to <hi>all</hi> men. <hi>Ezek. 23. 38, 39.

Oh the infinite graciouſneſs and kindneſs of this faithful and true witneſs, and of the Father in him! Oh that we may never abuſe ſuch goodneſs, or turn ſuch grace into wantonneſs!

When men are highly conceited of themſelves, and think that they are already rich, this will make them grow indifferent and remiſs and ſlothful; and though they come daily, and ſit before God as his people, and ſeem to take delight in approching to him, and remain in the aſſemblies of his people, yet it will make them do what they do out of Cuſtom, and for faſhion-ſake, or in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to ſome Idol, and it will cauſe them to be like a door that turneth upon his hinges, it will keep them at a ſtand; and though they go backward and forward like ſuch a door, yet they will at laſt be but where they were at firſt, they will not grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, it will hinder them from being <hi>hot,</hi> from ſuch a prizing of Chriſt as to hate all for his ſake, that they may win him, and be found in him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12, 16. <hi>The full Soul loatheth the Honey-combe, and that cauſeth a man alſo to wander from his place as a Bird from her neſt.</hi> Prov. 27. 7, 8.

<hi>knowledge</hi> (even the knowing and taking notice of our knowledge

Oh! conſider we this, that pride may be hidden from us, and that we may not be wiſe in our own eyes, but viewing our ſelves in the Glaſs of the Lord's body, may take ſhame to our ſelves; <hi>For pride goeth before deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an haughty Spirit before a fall.</hi> Prov.

Surely his Grace is vouchſafed to us to lay us low, and hide pride from us, and break us off from our high thoughts of our ſelves, and though the Spirit that dwelleth in us, as of us luſteth to envy, and leadeth us to lift up our ſelves: yet he giveth more Grace, Grace abounding and exceeding the corruption of our natural Spirit, that our lofty looks may be humbled, and our haughty hearts bowed down; wherefore he ſaith, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth Grace to the humble.</hi> Jam. 4. 5, 6. Humble we our ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, and ſuffer we thoſe high thoughts of our ſelves to be purged out of us, and mortified; or otherwiſe we ſhall never be ſervent in Spirit in ſeeking the Lord, and yielding up our ſelves unto him: The Apoſtle ſaw it needful and profitable to give this admonition to every one of the believers, that they ſhould not think more highly of themſelves, or of their parts, gifts, and attainments, then they ought to

<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5, 16. his end, while it is called to day, in threatning and lifting up his hand, is not firſtly to execute the judgment threatned, for that is his work, his ſtrange work, but to awaken us out of our ſleep, to make us afraid, that we might run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto him, prepare to meet him, and turn to him that ſmiteth, and ſeek the Lord of hoſts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he giveth good counſel to ſuch as have greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, and incenſed him againſt them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be abhorred by him; and it is out of his pity and compaſſion that he thus threatneth before he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and lifteth up his hand before he ſtriketh, this is out of faithfulneſs, and not out of hatred to us, that we might conſider our ſelves, and ways, and fall down before him, and turn from our iniquities, that we may underſtand his truth; and it is good and profitable for us to take notice of this, and ſet our hearts to it; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when God reproveth us in his word; when he

Oh that we may yet turn unto him from all our iniquities and idols, that he might turn again, and have compaſſion upon us, and delight to do us good, and make us glad according to the days where in he hath

<hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29, 31. But this more properly appertaineth to what followeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that he councelleth theſe miſerable ones to

This may give us ſomewhat to anſwer thoſe that abuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and pervert them to the hurt of themſelves, and others, when the Holy-Ghoſt inviteth every thirſter to come to the waters, to buy and eat; this is onely meant, ſay they, of ſuch as are ſenſible of their ſad condition, and ſuch as are gracious thirſters, which hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, when as indeed it appeareth moſt directly to be ſpoken to ſuch as thirſted out of neceſſity only, and who were ſeeking reſt, and ſatisfying in vain things that could not profit them, and therefore were reproved for ſo doing; and this I am ſure is no gracious frame, or qualification; for it is added,
<hi>Why do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread, and your labour or that, which ſatisfieth not.</hi> Iſa. 55. 1, 2. So when our Saviour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103338:39"/> ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden;</hi> this is ſpoken, ſay they, of ſuch as laboured for Chriſt, and were weary of, and willing to part with their ſins; when as ſuch are hereby invited, who did ſeek reſt where it was not to be had, ſuch as ſought to know the father by the wiſdom of this world, and ſo failed of their expectation: Hence our Saviour calleth them, <hi>all</hi> of them, to him, who knoweth the father, and none but he, and him to whomſoever he will reveal him, and in coming to him he would give them reſt from their burdening and unprofitable labour. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25, 29. And this is ſutable to what we have noted in this place; we ſee here, ſuch are called upon, and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to buy and purchaſe, and good counſel is given to them, whoſe caſe and condition was very bad and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and yet they knew it not, they were inſenſible

            <p n="4">4. In that he giveth ſuch Councel to theſe that were ignorant of their ſtate, he ſignifieth to us, that the way to make men ſenſible of their condition, when their caſe is wretched, and miſerable, and they know it not, is to commend to them, and lift up before them Chriſt, and thoſe treaſures in him, and to direct them thereunto, and not at firſt to preach the Law, or otherwiſe to uſe it, then according to the glorious Goſpel: <hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt is the Arm of the Lord,</hi> in which his power is put forth, and Spirit given, <hi>to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> ſo Chriſt ſath, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; becauſe the Lord hath anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor,</hi>—(and therewith)
<hi>to preach recovery of ſight to the blind,</hi> to preach their eyes open, in preaching the Goſpel. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. So our Savionr

In like manner alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent with this Goſpel, to open the eyes of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo to ſhew them what a ſad condition they were in, how well thoughted ſoever they were of themſelves. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18, 23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 4, 6. Hence alſo the Goſpel is called, <hi>The Word of Life.</hi> Phil. 2. 16. <hi>The Words of Chriſt are Spirit and life to them that believe not.</hi> John 6. 63.
<hi>The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple that know nothing.</hi> Pſal. 19. 7. &amp; 119. 130. The Goſpel is light, the

It is through his falling into the earth that he hath exalted, and advanced our nature ſo highly, that he is in it become the great God and our Saviour, the Lord and Chriſt, the heir of all things, and inheritour of God's holy mountain: Becauſe he humbled himſelf, <hi>therefore God highly exalted him, and gave him a name above every name: And he is gone up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and and is on the right hand of God, Angels, Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject to him. Heb.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.
21, 22. The Captain of our ſalvation is become perfect for us through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10.

22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 2. But this may be further ſpoken to in what is ſaid, and affirmed of this <hi>gold,</hi> to wit, <hi>that is tried in the fire.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is called and compared to <hi>gold,</hi> becauſe as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Gold is the moſt excellent metal which God hath created, ſo this faithful and true witneſs is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one, there is none to be compared to him: Gold is more precious then Iron, Braſs, Silver, or any other metal. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 22. So <hi>he is precious,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103338:43"/> excellent as the Cedars</hi> (namely, as the Cedars excel other trees, ſo doth he other perſons and things)
<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 15.

27, Col. 1. 18, 19. <hi>He is White and Ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand.</hi> Cant. 5. 10. <hi>he is fairer then the children of men. Pſal.</hi> 45. 2. Whatever beauty, or comely proportion they may have, their fairneſs is not to be compared to his; he is fair with the beauty of holineſs, and there is no blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, or ſpot in him, no ſin in him, or wrinckle of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and infirmity upon him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.

He is a more excellent High Prieſt then was <hi>Aaron,</hi> or any of the high Prieſts under the Law: A more excellent perſon, they, the Sons of men, he is Jeſus the Son of God,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. they had infirmity, <hi>but he is holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, ſeparate from Sinners, and made higher then the Heavens.</hi> Heb. 7. 26, 28. <hi>they were made after the law of a carnal commandment, but he after the power of an endleſs life.</hi> Heb. 7. 16, 17. <hi>they were made Prieſts without an oath, but he with an oath. Heb.</hi> 7. 20, 21. They were many Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death; <hi>But this man becauſe he continueth ever hath an unchangeable Prieſthood,</hi> which paſſeth not from him to any other (to no Vicar on earth) <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come to God by him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24, 25. They miniſtred about a worldly ſanctuary; <hi>but he is the Miniſter of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man. Heb.</hi> 9. 1. &amp; 8. 2. They offered up ſacrifices which could never take away ſin, for it was not poſſible that the blood of bulls and of goats could take away ſin; But this man, when he had offered up one ſacrifice for ſins for ever (even himſelf, his own body once for all) ſate down on the right hand of God, (from ever offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more a propitiatory ſacrifice) he needeth not daily as the former High Prieſts to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the peoples, for this he did once when he offered up himſelf. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 12. &amp; 7. 27. They entred into the holy places made with

8. 1. &amp; 9. 24. He is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then all Kings and Prophets in former times; he is anointed with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. God hath ſet this King upon his holy hill of
<hi>Zion,</hi> and raiſed up him a Prophet whom all are to hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto them; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will not hear this Prophet ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23. He is excellent in wiſdom above all men (for God hath not given the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by meaſure unto him) yea he is greater therein then <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was wiſer then all men. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 29, 31. with <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 42.
<q>He is more excellent then the mountains of Prey.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 4. This man is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then fine gold, even this man then the golden wedge of Ophir. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 12. Man knoweth not the price of this excellent one, this wiſdom that is from above, neither is it found in the land of the living—it cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the Saphire: the gold and the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal cannot equal it;—no mention ſhall be made of coral, or of pearls, for the price of wiſdom is above rubies; The Topaz of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> ſhall not equal it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall it be valued with pure Gold. <hi>Job</hi> 28.
13, 19. He that came down, and cometh down from above, is above all, above all other perſons and things; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is better then rubies, and all the things that may be deſired are not to be compared to him. <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 31.</q>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 10, 11. He is more excellent then all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the fleſh, and then all our works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, zeal, devotions, frames, and qualifications;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103338:45"/> and therefore the Apoſtle counted thoſe things that were formerly gain to him, and in which was his life, confidence and conſolation loſs for Chriſt,; yea, he went on to count all things as loſs and dung for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, that he might win him, <hi>&amp;c.

There is none ſo excellent, none ſo inriching as is this Spiritual and Heavenly Gold: He doth more; yea, inexpreſſibly more exceed all other perſons and things, then natural Gold doth excell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metals whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

<hi>Gold,</hi> eſpecially when tried, is very delightful and deſirable to the natural eye, the eye of the body, and that with which the heart is affected, even ſo Jeſus Chriſt is amiable to the inlightned eye of the underſtanding, as he is diſplayed before us in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of the Spirit; the riches of this world, and ſo <hi>Gold</hi> which is the moſt excellent part of it, taketh the eye, and delighteth the heart;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103338:48"/> hence it is called, <hi>The luſt of the eye.</hi> 1 John 2. 16. And the eye is ſaid to flee upon this, even as the Eagle or Hawk fleeth upon the prey, as if the life did conſiſt in the having and enjoying it (though indeed it doth not. <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 15.)
<hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 4, 5. Thus <hi>Achan</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>That when he ſaw two hundred shekels of Silver, and a Wedge of Gold, then be coveted them.</hi> Joſh. 7. 21. It drew his affection to, and deſire after them: Gold and the riches of this world are pleaſing to the eye and affect hearts of men, and cauſe them to love them, truſt in, and glory in the enjoyment of them; hence becauſe of the vanity, emptineſs and uncertainty of them, the Holy Ghoſt giveth ſuch frequent admonitions, <hi>Not to ſet the Eye upon them, not to ſet the Heart upon them, not to truſt or glory in them,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 23 5. Pſal. 62. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 17. Jet. 9. 23. And Holy men of God have prayed him to turn away their eyes from beholding this Object of covetouſneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 36, 37. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth to us how deſirable this is in itſelf, and to us all naturally; but behold a more excellent and pleaſant Object: We may ſay in this reſpect, Jeſus Chriſt may be called Gold; becauſe he is eminently, and moſt fully deſirable, and taking to the Soul, as he hath been tried in the firſt; he is compleatly delightful, and there is in him that which is powerful to draw the eye, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the heart unto him, and cauſe men to luſt after him; hence he is called <hi>The deſire of all Nations;</hi> becauſe he is wholy and altogether deſirable, and is, and hath in him eminently that which all Nations do deſire, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after, <hi>viz.</hi> That which may give reſt and ſatisfying to them (though through their fooliſhneſs they are ſeeking it in wrong Objects, even in that which is not) <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7.

<hi>thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet made himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Phil. 2. 6-8, Without controverſy, great is the myſtery of Godlineſs, God became man, the Word was made fleſh, the Lord became a Servant, he that was rich became poor, he that was in Heaven deſcended, and came into the Earth, and tabernacled among men. Oh! here was the trial of his love and faithfulneſs, here he was proved to purpoſe, and yet did abide it, and was faithful to him that appointed him, and loving and gracious to us, it is a great trial amongſt men, when one that is lifted up and advanced above his brethren, is put upon it to part with, and lay aſide that Glory; but his Glory was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more excellent, and his perſon inconceivably more worthy then that of any Earthly King or Emperour, and yet he ſo humbled himſelf, and came down, and emptied himſelf for us.</p>
            <p>His love and faithfulneſs was tried, and he was <hi>Gold tried,</hi> in that he indured all this from the hand of his father, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or permitted and ordered by him; it is a great probation, and toucheth the quick, when a moſt intimate lover woundeth with the wound of an enemy, with the chaſtiſement of a cruel one (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 14.) what he indured was from the hands of his father, who infinitely loved him, in whoſe boſom he was, and with whom he was well pleaſed; and yet by him he was caſt into the fire, and did chearfully and conſtantly abide it; yea, he was angry with, and ſharply reproved him that indeavoured to deliver him from this fire, or ſome part of it; <hi>The Cup</hi>

This was a trial of his confidence in his fathers love, and of his obedience to him, and yet he did abide faithful, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was jealous or diſtruſtful of his fathers affection, but in the midſt of the fire, and when through the heat of it he cryeth out and roareth, yet he cryeth out. <hi>Oh my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my God my God.</hi> Mat. 26. 42. &amp; 27. 46.

            <p>His love and faithfulneſs was proved, in that he upon his own account had not deſerved any thing of affliction or trouble from his father;

Oh how different is our carriage when we are in trouble and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we are apt to complain, and fret againſt God, and to be diſcontented, when we indeed ſuffer juſtly, and would be rid off, and delivered from the burden; though it is thank-worthy that a man taketh it patiently when he is corrected or buffeted for his faults. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.

<q>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others: Let that mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus; who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God; but made himſelf of no reputation,—and became obedient to death, the death of the Croſs, not for himſelf, but for us, and for our ſakes;</q> ſurely he

<hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> even the <hi>righteouſneſſes</hi> of the Saints, according to what

<q>I put on righteouſneſs, and it cloathed me.</q>

<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. As well as alſo Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered; becauſe there is no other perſon or thing that could redeem us:
<q>No man could redeem his Brother, nor give to God a ranſom for his Soul, the redemption of the Soul is ſo precious:</q> No Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed by the Law could purge away our ſin; God took no pleaſure in them to any ſuch end, thouſands of Rammes, and ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl, would not have made our peace; <hi>Lebanon</hi> was not ſufficient to burn, nor the Beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt Offering: All Nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him leſs then nothing, and vanity: Yea the Heavens were not clean in his ſight to this purpoſe, nor any of the Heavenly Spirits; but Chriſt muſt be abaſed and dye or us, or elſe there could be no righteouſneſs for us. <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi>

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 21-32.

            <p>Zeal for God, to be clad therewith as with a Cloak.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 7. This was that which this Angel and Church were much wanting in, and deſtitute of; they were <hi>Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm,</hi> and neither
<hi>Cold</hi> nor <hi>Hot,</hi> as we have ſeen before: This was needful therefore to be bought by them in and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103338:77"/> with humility, and unleſs that be put on, this cannot be had by us; for while men have high thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their attainments, this diſpoſeth them to luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, and hindreth them from being zealous. Now that zeal that is to be bought of Chriſt, it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, Fervency of Spirit in ſelling all that we have for Chriſt, that we may win him, and be found in him, as before is ſhewn. And fervency of Spirit in ſeeking after the knowledg of him, and promoting the things of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom contending earneſtly and fervently for the faith of the common ſalvation; and not giving place by ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no not for an hour, that the truth of the Goſpel may continue with us; and ſo highly valuing and prizing Chriſt and his Goſpel, and fervently loving him and it, as not to love our lives unto the death for his ſake, and his Goſpels, but willingly to lay them down, and loſe them, when called thereunto: The zeal of Gods houſe did even eat up Chriſt; and ſuch zeal is to be bought of him as whereby we may not pleaſe our ſelves, but deny our own wiſdoms, wills, deſigns, affections, enterprizes, yea, and forſake all that we have, that we may be his Diſciples, and follow him in the regeneration. <hi>Rom. 12. 11. Luke</hi> 14. 26, 27-33. And this zeal he is effecting in us, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and principally by lifting up himſelf by his Spirit, and rendring himſelf more precious then all the things of this world, then all our injoyments, relations, attainments, lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo we might run with the feet of our Souls, even with hot and fervent affections unto him, from all other things; <hi>Becauſe of the Lord his God, and for the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who hath glorified him.</hi> Iſa 55. 5.

<q>And laying aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet us, run with patience</q> (in induring afflictions, and in a patient continuance in well-doing, and patiently
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103338:77"/> waiting for the Lord) the race ſet before us, looking off from all other things unto Jeſus. Heb. 12. 1, 2, 3. This is a needfull and uſefull garment to be put on by us in and with Humility, in putting on the new man, and in being clad wherewith, we ſhall be Inſtruments of good to others and provoke very many to ſeek and follow the Lord with us. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. and eſpecially needfull for the Angels of the Churches, that they may be enſamples to the flock, and fervently ſeek their good. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 12, 13. And abundant need, and great cauſe have we now to buy this of Chriſt in theſe laſt, and lukewarme times,
<hi>in which iniquity doth abound, and the love of many wax Cold</hi> As was alſo ſoretold by our Saviour. <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 12. And to that end, that this Angel and Church might be zealous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (change, and forſake their evil and high thoughts of themſelves) therefore out of love and faithfulneſs, the faithful and true witneſs did rebuke and chaſten them,

               <hi>Bowels of mercy, kindneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Are alſo to be put on by his Angels and Churches; not only outward acts of mercy, but bowels of mercy, having an inward affection to men, pitying, and compaſſionating the ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the way; and being kind alſo, in heartily deſiring the good of them, that they may be ſaved. <hi>Col.</hi>
3. 12. And theſe garments aptly follow, and are joyned with zeal; for when the love, and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is ſo known, believed, and conſidered by us, as to inflame our hearts with love to him, together herewith alſo his love is ſo infuſed, and diffuſed into the heart by the holy Spirit, as to fill us with love to all, and ſo with bowels of mercy, pity, and compaſſion; and with an hearty kindneſs to them, and earneſt deſire, and indeavour of their good: This filleth with bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, yearning toward them, and breathing for their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103338:78"/> good, that their eyes might be opened, and that they might be turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God; the love of Chriſt known and believed frameth, and conſtraineth hereto: And ſo it frameth us to be like-minded unto Chriſt, and God in him,
<q>to be merciful as our father which is in Heaven is merciful.</q> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 36.

<hi>as forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint againſt any, even as Chriſt freely forgave them, that they ſhould do likewiſe.</hi> Col. 3. 12, 13. with Luk. 6. 36, 37. <hi>And as we have opportunity, doing good to all men, eſpecially to thoſe that are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> Gal. 6. 10. 1 Joh. 3. 16, 17, 18.—</p>

               <hi>Meekneſs</hi> is alſo to be put on by them as a garment.

               <q>Let it not be that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.—But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which </q>(though it be deſpiſed and laught at by men, yea, by many that profeſs godlineſs, yet)
<q>is in the ſight of God of great price; for after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the old time, the holy women alſo who truſted in God adorned themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And meekneſs and lowlineſs of heart were conjoyned in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 29. And unleſs we ſo receive the grace
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103338:78"/> of Chriſt as to be clothed with humbleneſs of mind, we cannot adorne our ſelves with this garment of a meek and quiet ſpirit: for pride and high thoughts of our ſelves will cauſe us to be ſoon angry, and fill us with contention, ſtrife, envying, confuſion, and every evil work. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 6. And this is to be exerciſed in ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion unto thoſe that God hath ſet over us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3-5.

            <p>
               <hi>Charity alſo is to be put on; Above all theſe things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi> Col. 3. 14. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things have fervent charity among your ſelves.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 8. <hi>Let all your things be done with charity. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 14.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103338:79"/> Charity is diſtinguiſhed from brotherly kindneſs. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. Brotherly kindneſs hath for its motive and object ſomewhat lovely, and amiable in the party loved; but Charity is a free manner of love, faſtening on, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth toward the party loved, not becauſe of any worth, or worthineſs in him, yea notwithſtanding great unworthineſs, and maniſold evils be found in him. Thus it is in God;
<hi>God ſo infinitely loved, pityed, and compaſſionated the world, that he gave his onely begotten ſon.</hi> There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of worth or worthineſs in the world to move him ſo to do, for all the world was become guilty before God, and ſubject to his judgment. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin. Rom.</hi> 3. 19. &amp; 5. 12. All were become ungodly, ſinners, and enemies; and ſo, great unworthineſs was found with them, yet he loved them, and ſo loved them as to give his Son to be the Saviour thereof; becauſe he himſelf is charity, the fountain and original of love. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8-10. Thus alſo it is in a meaſure with thoſe that have known and believed the love that God hath towards the world, and ſo are born of God: The charity they are inſtructed to put on, It is ſuch a manner of love as is towards another without any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or worthineſs in the party loved; yea, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great unlovelineſs be found in him; and it is begotten and moved, and exerciſed from an higher motive, and from a reaſon without him, namely, from the love of Chriſt, and God in him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7. I ſay unto you that hear, That God is love, and how he hath manifeſted it. <hi>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 27. This being put on, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the exerciſe of, <hi>will cover the multitude of ſins,</hi> ſo as ſtill to be ſeeking the good of the party loved. 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8. And indeed in putting on charity, we put on all the other garments before ſpoken of; and therefore above all things
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103338:79"/> this is to be put on by us: In putting this on we ſhall put on humility; <hi>for Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4. It taketh no notice of its doing or works, ſo as to be hindred from purſuing the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it leadeth one to humble himſelf to that end, as it was eminently found in Chriſt, ſuch was his Charity;
<q>as that though he was rich, for our ſakes he became poor: that through his poverty we might be inriched.</q> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>He humbled himſelf and became obedient to death,</hi> &amp;c. Charity doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, as thoſe that want humility do, in proclaiming their own goodneſs, knowledge, <hi>&amp;c. Philip.</hi> 2. 3-7. In putting on this we ſhall put on zeal, and fervency in looking upon, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the good of others, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt, and hence this is called <hi>fervent Charity.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 8.
<hi>And is ſo fervent and hot as that many waters cannot quench it, neither can the flouds drown it; it is even ſtrong as death. And caſteth out all fear that hath torment in it.</hi> Cant. 8. 6, 7. 1 Joh. 4. 18. In putting on this we put on bowels of mercy, kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it filleth with bowels of pity, and compaſſion towards others; Charity ſeeketh not her own, but the profit of others that they may be ſaved. <hi>Charity is kind.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5. Hence our Saviour firſt inſtructeth his Diſciples <hi>to love, and then to do good, to lend, to be merciful, not to judge, not to condemn, to give, forgive,</hi> &amp;c. As ſignifying, love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, and leadeth to all mercy and kindneſs, and acts of it.
<hi>Luke</hi> 6. 27-38. Charity openeth the bowels of our compaſſion on ſight of the needs, and neceſſities of others. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16-18. In putting on Charity we put on alſo meekneſs and gentleneſs in bearing injuries, unkindneſſes, and ill requitals from others, and in being long-ſuffering toward them, and not preſently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from them though they be dull of hearing,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103338:80"/> unteachable, untractable: yea, though they are froward, evil, and incenſed againſt us, and are enemies to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we tell them the truth, and indeavour their good and profit. Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind all the while; it is not eaſily provoked, thinketh, projecteth, ſurmiſeth no evil, it is even blind, and leadeth thoſe that are filled with it to demean themſelves as blind ones. Who ſo full of Charity as Chriſt? <hi>And who</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is blind as my ſervant, or deaf as my meſſenger that I ſent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lords ſervant, ſeeing many things, but thou obſerveſt them not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 19, 20.
<q>So alſo Charity beareth all things, indureth all things, all burdens caſt upon it, and yet Charity never faileth.</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.
5-7, 8. All is included in one word, <hi>Thou ſhalt love,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8-10.—</p>
            <p n="2">2, And by the fruits of righteouſneſs, and ſo by thoſe <hi>White garments,</hi> are meant, thoſe more outward; the works and acts of love and mercy, exerciſed unto others; ſo receiving and holding faſt the Grace of God, as that in its efficacies and outward works, it may be ſeen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held of all men. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23.

1 Tim. 2. 9, 10. And to that end the Grace of God moveth, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to caſt off the works of darkneſs, ſuch as rioting and drunkenneſs, chambring and wantonneſs, ſtrife and envying, which are the garments of darkneſs, proceeding from our ignorance and blindneſs; theſe are to be caſt off as an unclean, filthy and diſhonourable garment: <hi>and to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the efficacies of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

5, 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10-12. And ſo by this <hi>White raiment</hi> is meant, the righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath wrought and compleated for all without them, and which he is become through and by means of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal abaſement and ſufferings, and the fruits thereof, both thoſe more inward and outward.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why this raiment is ſaid to be <hi>White,</hi> and what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported therein?</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general we may ſay, in this expreſſion there is alluſion and reference unto the Garments that the Prieſts and Levites did wear, and were clothed with, and in which they did then miniſter; which
<hi>Moſes,</hi> the Mediator of that old Teſtament or Covenant, was appointed to make, or cauſe to be made. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 39-43.
<hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 4-23-32. So it is ſaid, the Levites, when they miniſtred, <hi>were arayed in white linen.</hi> 2 Chron. 5. 12. <hi>And now the Prieſthood being changed, there is made of neceſsity a change alſo of the Law.</hi> Heb. 7. 12. We have an High prieſt after a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order then was <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, even after the order of
<hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> and he is King of righteouſneſs, who hath brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, and who is cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith as with a robe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 10. And hath it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon, and cloth with, all that are born of him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1, 2. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2. 29. &amp; 3.
7. This was he whom <hi>Daniel</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:103338:81"/> in viſion ſaw, <hi>That certain</hi> (or one) <hi>man, clohed in linen,</hi> in White raiment, <hi>whoſe Loyns were girded with fine Gold of</hi> Uphaz. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 5. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.
13. And the ſame he ſpeaketh off again, <hi>Clothed in linen, which was upon the Waters of the River,</hi> &amp;c. Dan. 12. 6, 7. with Rev. 10. 6, 7.
<hi>And he is girt about the Paps with a Golden girdle. Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Girdle of his Loyns, and Faithfulneſs the Girdle of his Reins.</hi> Rev.
1. 13. with Iſa. 11. 5. He is a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent High-prieſt then any of the former, and anſwerably his raiment is more excellent then theirs.
<hi>Aaron</hi> had on, when he miniſtred the Linen Coat, Linen Breeches, Linen Girdle, and Linen Mitre, outward Material, white Raiment; but he hath put on righteouſneſs as his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Girdle, Breaſt-Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all thoſe that are born of, and come unto him, are made Prieſts, be they Jew or Gentile, wiſe or unwiſe, male or female, bond or free. They are a Spiritual Prieſt-hood, to miniſter unto him, as all the males that were born of <hi>Aaron</hi> in former times were Prieſts; ſo now Chriſt is actually in our nature glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and become the father and begetter of Prieſts by a birth from above, and no difference here between male and female; <hi>for they are all one in Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3. 27. This pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of being Prieſts is not confined or limited to a mid-order of outward Officers, between and diſtinct from Biſhops or Elders, and Deacons; for there is no ſuch order mentioned in the writings of the Apoſtles; nor is it limited to any outward Church-choſen Officers whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Nay, men are ſo far from being the only Prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe choſen by the profeſſed Church, that they are not therefore Prieſts at all. But all thoſe that are born of Chriſt the Everlaſting father, and begetter of Prieſts, whether in, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or out of outward Office in the Church, are an Holy Nation, and Gods Heritage, or Clergy. 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. Yea, though thoſe that were in former times born of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103338:81"/> were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> were outward and bodily Prieſts to offer bodily Sacrifices, in which they were Types of Chriſt, and their Sacrifices, of his; Yet all <hi>Iſrael</hi> might then in obeying his voice have been Spiritual Prieſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 3-6. <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and tell the Children of</hi> Iſrael (and not of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> only) <hi>You have ſeen what I did to the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>&amp;c. Now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Treaſure unto me above all people; for all the Earth is mine: And ye ſhall be unto me a Kingdom of Priests, and an Holy Nation: Theſe are the Words which thou ſhalt ſpeak unto unto the Children of Iſrael. And now, all that come unto Chriſt the living Stone, diſallowed indeed of men,</hi> yea, of the builders alſo, <hi>but choſen of God and precious, they alſo as lively Stones are built up a Spiritual houſe, an Holy Prieſthood.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. And there are none elſe that are Prieſts of Gods owning, and approbation, though there are many others that are called ſo; but all theſe, whether male or female in the fleſh, that ſo hear and learn of the father as to come unto Chriſt, are joyned unto the Lord, and ſo are Spiritual <hi>Levites,</hi> and made one Spirit with him, and partake of his Spiritual Bleſſings by faith, and in a firſt-fruits of the Spirit, according to their needs and capacities, and they are Prieſts: And that they may miniſter unto him and before men, he waſheth them in his own Blood. Thus in our Types that the Prieſts might miniſter unto the Lord, they were to be waſhed. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 4. And when they came into the Tabernable, or unto the Altar, they were always to waſh. <hi>Exod</hi> 30. 17-22. <hi>And therefore the Laver was ſet between the Tent of the Congregation, and the Altar, that they might waſh before they came to the Altar.</hi> Exod. 40. 6,
7. 29-32. So Chriſt who is the Laver and Fountain of living Waters through his Blood,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103338:82"/> waſheth thoſe that come to, and believe on him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, even the weakeſt as well as the ſtrongeſt. He forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their iniquities even of the little Children alſo, and they receive the remiſſion of them through the opening of his name. 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. <hi>He ſprinkleth their Hearts from an evil Conſcience, and their Conſciences from dead works, and their Bodies with pure Water.</hi> He gave himſelf for his Church, <hi>that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water by the Word.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25, 26. Heb. 10. 22. And as in our Types of old the Prieſts had peculiar Veſtments, white Garments prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, and put on, to miniſter in. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 5, 6. &amp; 40. 13, 14. So Chriſt clotheth his Prieſts alſo with more excellent Raiment; <hi>He clotheth them with a robe of righteouſneſs.</hi> Iſa. 61. 10. Pſal.
132. 9. <hi>He is made of God to them righteouſneſs.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. And with the fruits of his righteouſneſs, as before. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23,
24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10-14. And he anointeth them, not with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Oyntment, as the Prieſts in former times were. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 6. &amp; 30. 23-30. &amp; 40. 9-13-15. But with the Spirit, and with ſome uſeful gifts. 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. And ſo they are prepared <hi>to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Chriſt,</hi> as their High-Prieſt and Altar. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Rev,</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>And the Sacrifices they offer are broken and contrite hearts,</hi> broken off from all rejoycing in themſelves, or confidence in the fleſh, and filled with abhorrency of, and ſorrow for their ſins. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 1-3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. And Prayers unto God in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. &amp; 50.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103338:82"/> God is well pleaſed, being offered by Chriſt as the Altar.</hi> Heb. 13. 15, 16.—</p>
            <p>Or as this counſel is given directly and expreſly to the Angel, that he ſhould buy <hi>White raiment;</hi> ſo there may be reference had to the Raiment the Angels, thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits, were wont to appear in; as it is ſaid of that Angel that rolled back the ſtone from the door of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre wherein the body of our Lord was laid, <hi>That his Raiment was white as Snow.</hi> Mat. 28. 2, 3. Mark. 16. 5 The like alſo is ſaid of the Angels that ſpake to Chriſts Diſciples, when he was taken up into Heaven.
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10. And of that which appeared to <hi>Cornelius. Acts</hi>
10. 3-30. See alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6.—</p>
            <p>And it is needful that the Angels of the Churches eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſhould be arayed with <hi>White raiment,</hi> and not with works of darkneſs, and in putting on Chriſt as their righteouſneſs, and the fruits of righteouſneſs, they have thoſe Garments, as is before ſhewn, and are therein in ſome meaſure like to Angels, meetly apparalled to carry the glad tidings of the Goſpel, and to be Inſtruments of of good to others in word and converſation. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 2-8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 7-11. 1

            <p n="2">2. More particularly this Raiment is ſaid to be

While men ſee them cloathed with, and appear before God onely in the righteouſneſs of another, even of Chriſt, who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification; it preſerveth them from having idolatrous eſteems of them, and worſhipping them; for herein they may ſee that they are ſinners in themſelves, and men of like paſſions with others, and that they could not work righteouſneſs for themſelves; nor have they any other righteouſneſs to be cloathed with, and rejoyce before God in, then that which is manifeſted by the faith of Chriſt to be for all poor ſinners aſwell as themſelves.

            <p>Our outward bodily garments will not cover our ſhame from the eyes of him with whom we have to do, unto whom all things are naked (though they may cover that of the outward Man from men) nor from them who have the eyes of their underſtandings opened in and by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt; but ſtill our vileneſs and ſinfulneſs will appear, notwithſtanding them: The moſt rich, coſtly, and neat aray, yea, all the glory and ſplendour of the World, will not cover our filth and uncomelineſs, our ſin and miſery; but on the contrary, the ſhame of our nakedneſs doth more appear oftentimes through, and by means of this outward clothing; and there it may be ſeen

See how on this account God threatneth to deal with the daughters of
<hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (Women, it ſeemeth, being through their weakneſs moſt inſident to this vanity and evil; and moſt frequently polluted herewith)
<hi>Moreover the Lord ſaith, Becauſe the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking, and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: Therefore the Lord will ſmite with a ſcab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and will make naked their ſecret parts. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about their feet; and their cauls</hi> (or net-works)
<hi>and their round tires like the Moon; the chains, and the bracclets, and the mufflers; the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the head bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings: the rings, and noſe jewels, the changeable ſuits of apparel; and the mamles, and the wimples, and the criſping pins, the glaſſes, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vailes: And it ſhall come to paſs, that inſtead of ſweet ſmell, there ſhall be ſtink; and in ſtead of a girdle a rent; and in ſtead of well ſet hair, baldneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 16-26.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103338:89"/> of inſobriety in this outward and bodily aray: And therefore the Holy Ghoſt hath given ſuch like warnings by his ſervants, that they

<q>ſhould have a chaſt converſation; and not adorne themſelves with that outward, of plaiting the hair, or wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel. </q>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1-4. For even belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers themſelves as men and Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> are apt to exceed in this outward clothing, and to glory herein, as if this would hide their ſhame, and beautify them: And from their too high eſteem hereof they are ready to

            <p>Nor will our wiſdom, or any excuſes, or coverings thereby made, cover the ſhame of our nakedneſs from the eyes of him before whom all things are naked, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: We think, many times, this way to hide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal our ſinfulneſs and vileneſs, as <hi>Adam</hi> did at firſt:
<hi>He covered his tranſgreſſion by hiding his iniquity in his boſome:</hi> Job. 31. 33. So we would hide and cover our ſhame, or ſome part of it, by ſhameful coverings; and this many ways.—As,</p>
            <p>Sometimes by keeping ſilence, and not confeſſing our ſin and ſinfulneſs when reproved. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3, 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.
13.—</p>
            <p>Sometimes men hide their ſin and ſhame under their tongues, when though they ſay, they have ſinned, and are ſinners, becauſe this is generally acknowledged, and therefore it is no ſhame ſo to confeſs; yet they confeſs not their proper iniquity for which God is rebuking them; or they extenuate and excuſe it. <hi>Job.</hi> 20. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they ſeek to cover one ſin with another, and add ſin to ſin, that they may cover their ſhame: As ſometimes, men ſeek to cover their adultery, or unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with murder, or with ſome other ſin. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 4-8-13-15. &amp; 12. 12. Or to hide their theft by lying, or by ſwearing and forſwearing, thinking this way to clear themſelves. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 2, 3. &amp; 19. 11, 12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 9. Yea this way of lying is a general covering men have wherewith they think to cover their other evils, not from men onely, but from God alſo; to which Satan is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men powerfully; and in, and walking in which they are very like to Satan; for he uſeth lying in all his ſinning
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103338:90"/> at firſt, and always from the beginning:
<hi>When he ſpeaketh a lye he ſpeaketh of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.</hi> Jer. 2. 23, 35. Joh. 8. 44. And great need have we, every one of us, to pray with <hi>David, remove from me the way of lying, and grant me thy law graciouſly</hi> Pſal. 119. 29. Sometimes men think to cover their evils by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them in ſecret, and in the dark: <hi>The murderer in the night is as a Thief: The eye alſo of the Adulterer wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the twilight, ſaying, none eye ſhall ſee me; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſeth his face: In the dark they dig through houſes—they know not the light; for the morning is to them even as the ſhadow of death; if one know them they are in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the ſhadow of death.</hi> Job. 24. 14-17. &amp; 22. 12-17. Iſa. 29. 15, 16. So thoſe that perſecute and murder the innocent many times do it in the dark, or in ſecret, pretending that they are enemies to them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they worſhip God, but becauſe they are deceivers, and malefactours, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 30. &amp; 19. 12. So thoſe that walk in abominable idolatry act it in the dark many times.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 7-12. And generally thoſe groſs luſts and evils are therefore called works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe men commit and ſerve them in the dark. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7. And hereby the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity think to hide themſelves, though they are greatly miſtaken and deceived: For
<q>there is no darkneſs or ſhadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves.</q> 
               <hi>Job</hi> 34. 21, 22. Sometimes men think to cover their other evils with hypocriſie; feigning and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves to be worſhippers of God, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, that they may continue in their ſins unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13.
<hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 14, 15. So thoſe that came to intangle our Saviour in his talk, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governour, feigned themſelves juſt men. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 20-23. And of

               <hi>Iſrael</hi> generally it is ſaid,
<hi>every one is an hypocrite, and an evil deer;</hi> they thought to cover their evil doings with their hypocrifie. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 17. Sometimes, and too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, men think to hide their ſin and ſhame, by charging God fooliſhly therewith; Thus <hi>Adam</hi> ſought to hide his iniquity by laying it ſecretly upon God himſelf, as if he were the cauſe of it,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12. And men bely the holy one, and think this way to cover their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, either.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſaying he is the author of their ſin, and moveth them to what is evil, as too too many do, who ſay, all is of God, and therefore there is no ſin; or that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth, and inclineth them to evil: Nay the holy Ghoſt ſeeth it needful to give this warning to the believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man Jam.</hi> 1. 13. Oh what wickedneſs is in our hearts! Rather then we will take ſhame to our ſelves, and acknowledge our evils, we are naturally ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him who is moſt juſt, and to impute evil to him who is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs; yea, who is of purer eyes then to behold evil. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 5, 6. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13.

            <p>Now then in this inſtruction contained in the end propoſed to move us to buy this <hi>White raiment, viz. [that thou mayſt be clothed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear]</hi> is further ſignified unto us.—</p>
            <p n="1">1.

<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7-9. And this forgiveneſs of ſins, as it is an imputing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without works, ſo it is expreſſed by covering ſin; even as <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom the Lord

               <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2-5. To the ſame purpoſe alſo the Pſalmiſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when he acknowledgeth to the praiſe of Gods Grace, and as a ground of incouragement to deſire his further mercy.

And indeed the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which he hath brought in and is become, is to this end a compleat clothing and covering for all our ſhame; inaſmuch as there is contained therein both an acquittance and juſtification from the guilt of our firſt ſin and ſinfulneſs; aſwell as alſo plenteous redemption, even the forgiveneſs of mens following and perſonal ſins, in which they ſin after the likeneſs and ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; yea, and in him there is perfect innocency, integrity, immortality, and eternal life; which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is now receiving by faith, and in ſome firſt-fruits of the Spirit; but the adoption, the redemption of the body, and the Harveſt of the Spirit, is to be waited for till the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven; but even now; thoſe that with the heart believe in him;
<q>They are made by faith the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt: Chriſt is made of God to them righteouſneſs; their ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them for his name ſake; he loveth them and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them therefrom in his own Blood; and they are made accepted in the beloved: And he in the body of his fleſh through death doth and will preſent them holy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and unrebukeable in his ſight, they continuing

               <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22, 23. Oh infinite Grace of God in Chriſt to ſinners! Oh bleſſed and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs!

            <p n="2">2. This <hi>White raiment</hi> is that alſo wherewith we may be clothed; that is to ſay, covered from the Rain, and Storm of Gods wrath, and from the evil of all adverſities and afflictions. This is one uſe of raiment, as to cover our nakedneſs, ſo alſo to be a covering from the Storms, and Cold that otherwiſe would annoy and hurt us, ſo it is here; Jeſus Chriſt, who of God is made to the believers righteouſneſs, and who is become <hi>White raiment,</hi> doth hide and ſecure them from the evil of all judgments, wrath, and afflictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So when the Pſalmiſt had been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Thou haſt covered all the ſins of thy people;</hi> he addeth. <hi>Thou haſt taken away all thy wrath.</hi> Pſal.

And this was not whiſpered, or ſpoken in ſecret, or in the ear, by our Saviour; but publickly ſpoken, and loudly proclaimed by him, that we might know he was not aſhamed of reporting this good
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103338:96"/> news; Jeſus cried, and ſaid,—<hi>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not</hi> (in this day of grace and patience) <hi>for I came not to judge the world but to ſave the world.</hi> Joh. 12. 44-47. It was in love, in infinite pity and compaſſion to the world of mankind, and ſo to thoſe that are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, that God gave his only begotten Son; And therefore it is thus expreſſed by his Son, and that diſciple whom Jeſus loved; <hi>God ſo loved the World,</hi> ſo infinitely, in expreſſibly, yea inconceivably merciful, and kind was he, <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Joh. 3. 16. 1 Joh. 4. 8-11-14.

            <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt took upon him the nature of all men; and was, as the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and ſo the witneſs and evidence of the truth and mercy of God to them, in whom God hath ſhewed himſelf to be a God keeping covenant and mercy. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 54,

<hi>is born this day a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord: And the multitude of the heavenly hoſt confirm, and ſet their ſeal to the truth hereof, praiſing God, and ſaying; glory be to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, on earth peace, goodwill</hi> (not evil will) <hi>towards men.</hi> Luk. 2. 10-14. Hence alſo he is ſo frequently called; <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> yea, only ſo called when one perſon is ſpoken of (indeed when ſpoken to,
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> are ſo called; but he is never ſo called when ſpoken to, but always when ſpoken off, or ſpeaking of himſelf.) I ſay, He is ſo often called <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> even of that kind or ſpecies of creatures; becauſe he partook of the nature of man, and undertook their cauſe, and was the Heir of man's miſery, to the end he might become their Saviour: And by means of the King's making a marriage for his only begotten Son, in which our nature was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Divine nature in the perſon of the word the Son of God, all things are ready and prepared for all mankind: Which doth clearly intimate to us, that he came into the world in a publick capacity and condition, for the good, and behoof of all men.

O! let us not ſay, we are ſuch unworthy ones, and have ſo evilly and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully requited him, that he will be no more gracious to us; He knoweth us better then we know our ſelves;
<q>He is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things.</q> And ſeeing he inviteth us, let us not delay, or make excuſes, or ſo give way to our diſcouragements as to ſay, The caſe is deſperate; but let us return to him from whom we have departed by our iniquities: He knew theſe to whom he givith this gracious counſel, who knew not themſelves; and knew them to be piteous miſerable ones; and yet he giveth this good counſel to them.

Let it be ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us that we may not ſo mind our wretchedneſs as to continue at a diſtance from him; but receive we his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and be wiſe, and not refuſe it.

She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged her ſelf to be as bad as ſhe was called; but ſhe did not therefore conclude there was no mercy for her; no, but conſidered what there was for ſuch an one as was as bad as ſhe was called. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 22-28. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his graciouſneſs might make us willing alſo to come, ſuch as we are, and to let go all things for this rich and bleſſed commodity, for that is needful to our partaking of it; And this leadeth us to the next Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—<hi>Viz.</hi>—</p>

            <p n="1">1. What is this <hi>buying</hi> here called for, and counſelled unto?</p>
            <p>The buying this excellent proviſion, It is a getting it into our poſſeſſion, an having, or obtaining it: hence whereas
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103338:103"/> in one place the Holy Ghoſt ſaith,
<hi>get Wiſdom,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thy gettings <hi>get underſtanding.</hi> In another place, He ſaith, <hi>buy wiſdom and underſtanding.</hi> Compare <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 5-7. with <hi>chap.</hi> 23. 23. It is an having a property and right in, and title to it as ones own; againing or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. Truly God hath given us man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind eternal life, and this life is in his Son, as in a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and treaſury: and ſo as included therein he hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us gold, <hi>white raiment,</hi> durable riches and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And ſo it is every man's own by Chriſt's purchaſe, and God's gift in him. The true riches, in that reſpect, are more ours, then the <hi>Mammon</hi> of unrighteouſneſs is.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 10, 11. but yet no man hath this life, or thoſe riches, but he that receiveth, hath, and is poſſeſſed of Chriſt, in whom is this proviſion; and with whom God giveth, and in receiving whom men receive all things by faith, and in ſome firſt-fruits of the ſpirit. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
5. 10-12. <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>And thoſe that by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lying vanities forſake him, they forſake their own mercy.</hi> Jonah 2. 8. it is indeed their own mercy, but they have it not; but by this means deprive themſelves of it: But <hi>the buying</hi> is an obtaining, having, and receiving theſe excellent things here propoſed to, and ſet before us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why is this getting, receiving, and having this
<hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>White raiment</hi> called and compared to <hi>buying</hi> here, and elſewhere? To that we may anſwer—1. Negatively. 2. Affirmatively.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, Not as if we had any thing of real, or equivalent worth, or value, to part with and give for this excellent proviſion here invited to. Thus men uſually buy commodities in this world, by parting with money, or ſome other thing for them, which is, or is looked upon to be in ſome meaſure worthy that they buy, and get a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103338:104"/> property in; but ſo it is not called
<hi>buying</hi> here. And this will in ſome meaſure appear if we conſider theſe things.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. The things here commended to us are the principal, and moſt excellent things, and no other thing is to be compared to them; this proviſion here invited to is above all, above all the things we may, or can deſire; and much more above thoſe we are poſſeſſed of. That which is ſaid of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> may be ſaid of this alſo; <hi>it is more precious then Rubies, and all the things we can deſire are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared herewith: Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of the living.—It cannot be gotten for Gold, neither ſhall Silver be weighed for the price thereof; it cannot be valued with the Gold of Ophir, with the precious Onyx, or the Saphire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.
13-15. &amp; 8. 10, 11. &amp; 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 17. It is even the Lord himſelf, and what is treaſured up in him, <hi>and all nations are before him as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs then nothing, and vanity: To whom then ſhall we liken him? or what likeneſs ſhall we compare unto him?</hi> Iſa. 40. 15-18-25. &amp; 46. 5, 6. The world and all the things thereof; and all we injoy, and are poſſeſſed of, are not to be compared to this unſearchably rich treaſure which we are here counſelled to <hi>buy. Cant</hi> 8. 7.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it alſo appeareth that by <hi>buying</hi> is not meant parting with any thing as a valuable conſideration, if we conſider what manner of perſons they are that are counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to buy; to wit, ſuch as had no worth or worthineſs in them, ſuch as were indigent worthleſs creatures; ſuch as were wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked; and therefore ſuch as could give nothing in exchange for this excellent commodity, that might in the leaſt be valuable therewith, or comparable thereto; And elſewhere ſuch are invited to <hi>buy</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:103338:104"/> that have no money nor price.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it further appeareth that this is not meant by
<hi>buying,</hi> becauſe it is highly provoking to God to think that we can purchaſe the gift of God with any thing we have as a valuable conſideration: This was the great and hainous iniquity of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> to think that the gift of God might be purchaſed with money: And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> Act. 8.
18-23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this is called, and compared to <hi>buying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe we muſt part with ſomewhat that we may be made partakers of Chriſt; As in in buying any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity a man muſt part with one thing for another; ſo here, We muſt part with what we have, even all that we have of our own. We muſt be like the wiſe Merchant, who when he had found one <hi>Pearl of great price,</hi> he went and ſold all that he had, and bought it. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 44-46. So muſt we do, we muſt part with and forſake all we have, that we may have this <hi>Gold, and white raiment;</hi> As to ſay, We muſt at firſt and always let go our Pride, and high thoughts and conceits of our ſelves, and of our being in a good condition already, and without Chriſt: This was the great and fundamental evil found with theſe, as is before noted; they ſaid they were rich, and increaſed with goods, and had need of nothing; and hereby they grew remiſs and lukewarm; and therefore unleſs this evil and high conceit of themſelves were abſtained from, and parted with by them, how could they with fervency ſeek the Lord? Hence this faithful and gracious counſellour inſtructeth and admoniſheth them. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Be zealous and repent;</hi> and the latter is needful to the former; And ſo it is as if he ſhould ſay, that you may with earneſtneſs
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103338:105"/> and intention of ſpirit ſeek to know and be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt, and thoſe durable riches in him; need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is that you repent, change your minds, let go your proud and lofty thoughts and conceits of your ſelves, and of the goodneſs of your preſent condition, that you may ſeek the Lord, the Lord himſelf, and that ſubſtantial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in him; Forſake your unrighteous thoughts, without which you cannot return to the Lord, with whom is plenteous redemption. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
55. 1-6, 7. Waſh your hearts from wickedneſs, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within you? <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. This haughty concert of the goodneſs of their preſent condition, was that which hindered the leaders of the people in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39, 40. &amp; 9. 40, 41. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 45. God doth in due time give grace to us, that we might have our high thoughts of our ſelves ſubdued, and that we might hate them. Oh! that it may be received by us to ſuch end and purpoſe. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4,

            <p>So alſo we muſt let go, and forſake our double mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and halting between two opinions. This Angel
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103338:105"/> and Church were ſomewhat polluted herewith, they were lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot; they were not ſo cold, as to leave off all profeſſed waiting upon Chriſt, and uſe and obſervance of his ordinances; nor ſo hot, as to be chaſtly and ſingly for him, to be for him, and for him only; which is a very ſad and nauſeous diſtemper, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loathſome and provoking to Chriſt Jeſus: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needful it is that we cleanſe our ſelves in the light and ſtrength of God's grace here-from. And indeed this is the conſequent of pride and high conceits of our ſelves, and of the goodneſs of our conditions, and of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and injoyments, as hath been foreſhewn; and as alſo appeareth in <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5, 6-8.

Yea, this is that they call <hi>charity,</hi> to have a good opinion and eſteem of all that make a fair face in the fleſh; though many of them preach another Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, or Spirit, or Goſpel, beſides him whom the Apoſtles have preached, or that the believers have received and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, when as indeed it is not
<hi>charity:</hi> For charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth; but it is the fruit of their inſtability, and want of fervent love to Chriſt and his Goſpel, which, were it in them, would cauſe them not to indure evil doctrines, nor thoſe that bring them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2-6.

            <p n="2">2. This gaining Chriſt, and that preparation in him, is alſo called and compared to <hi>buying,</hi> becauſe that which we muſt part with, though it be indeed nothing worth, yet we have naturally a goodly, and high eſteem thereof; it is naturally highly valued by us, and of very great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with us, through our blindneſs and ignorance: We are by nature and firſt birth empty, and void of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual underſtanding; though we would be wiſe, yet we are born like a wild Aſſes Colt; hence we are ready to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, to call evil good, and good evil; to put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light; To make an Idol of Chriſt, and God in him, and to prefer broken Ciſterns
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103338:110"/> before the fountain of living waters: We are ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be highly eſteeming, and valuing our own things, which we muſt ſell, and let go that we may have Chriſt, and thoſe unſearchable riches of him; eſpecially ſuch things as are commendable amongſt men, and which are the object of the deſires of the mind; as to ſay par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly: <hi>The wiſdom of this world is</hi> of high account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, and men are apt to glory herein, as if it were ſome goodly thing: Though it is, and is declared to be, <hi>fooliſhneſs with God;</hi> and every man by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is bruitiſh, and like a beaſt. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. 19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 14. &amp; 51. 17. Yet this is unto a man in his natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as his right eye; this is that which he is moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of, and moſt highly prizeth; and he looketh upon it as a moſt uſeful and beneficial thing, both for knowing and finding out God in the wiſdom of God, and for glorifying him to others; though he is much miſtaken herein. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Matt. 18. 9. And thoſe that have more of it then others, and are rich in this wiſdom and knowledg, look upon themſelves in the injoyment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as happy perſons, yea, as the only bleſſed ones; and judge and give forth others to be accurſed.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 47—49. <hi>And are ready to ſay as they did; the law ſhall not periſh from the Prieſt, nor Counſel from the wiſe.</hi> Jer. 18. 18. Doubtleſs (as is before ſaid) this is one of the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and Gods of the world; and too much, and too often, ſet up alſo in the temple of God, to the polluting and defiling it; which men adore and worſhip, and lift up themſelves by, and make their boaſt of; and upon every occaſion ask counſel of this ſtock, and this ſtaff declareth to them. So alſo the works and doings of the fleſh, which are wrought by the wiſdom and ſtrength thereof, our own righteouſneſs according to the Law, this is highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt men; and men are apt to confide herein, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103338:111"/> think on this account eternal life appertaineth to them: This is even their life, their riches, their gain; though in truth it be nothing worth, for we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy raggs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64 6. Thus it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he had his confidence in the fleſh; he was alive once without the Law, he thought himſelf to be in a very good and happy condition. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. His own righteouſneſs which was of the Law was gain to him, before the righteouſneſs of God without the Law was believed and received by him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4-7-9. And thus it was more generally with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
               <q>they truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others. </q>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 9. And even ſo it is now: Thoſe who are ſeeking righteouſneſs as it were by the works of the Law, and according thereto have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to avoid the evils thereby forbidden; and to do and perform the things thereby required and injoyned; ſuch as have a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; and who are eſtabliſhing a righteouſneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they have high and goodly eſteems and conceits of of their own works, zeal, appearing righteouſneſs, and holineſs; this is money and price in their eye naturally, though it be filthy and unprofitable in the pure eyes of God. So the riches of this world, which are the object of covetouſneſs, are highly accounted of amongſt men, though they are uncertain riches, the <hi>Mammon</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and not the true riches. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9-12. But ſuch as periſh; and which while injoyed render not a man any whit the more truly happy in the account of God; yet how do men bleſs themſelves hereby, and think highly of themſelves? and how do they truſt herein as if they were therefore in the favour of God! This <hi>Mammon</hi> is one of the Gods of the World alſo, which men, while they are judging and acting as men, do give their loves
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103338:111"/> unto, and place their affections upon, and delight in; and in time of trouble cry thereto, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe and ſave us.</hi> And ſo we might ſay of all the reſt, but ſhall not inlarge hereto any further particularly in this place. But in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral we may ſay; the body of ſin is called fleſh; and the affections and luſts thereof, <hi>our members,</hi> ſuch as <hi>fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſence, and covetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe they are naturally ſo near and dear to us, ſo greatly valued and highly prized by us, as <hi>our ſelf, our life, riches, goods, right eye, hand, foot,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 8, 9. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 43, 45, 47. Therefore the parting with theſe that we may obtain that durable riches and righteouſneſs in Chriſt, is well called and compared to <hi>Buying,</hi> becauſe though they are really and in truth nothing worth, yet we have ſuch an over-high account of them, and ſuch an indeared affection to them naturally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This winning Chriſt and that proviſion in him is called, and compared to <hi>buying,</hi> becauſe as in <hi>buying,</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and diligence is to be uſed and exerciſed; and to that end there muſt be ſome high account of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to be bought, for it's worth, neceſſity, or uſefulneſs, without which men will not ordinarily be diligent. Thus it was with <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons when they went down into
<hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> Bread, what diligence and earneſtneſs was found with them, in going ſuch a long journey to get proviſion for themſelves; becauſe they knew they could not, in an ordinary way, ſubſiſt without it? <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 2-10. And thus alſo that we may partake of this <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>white raiment,</hi> needful it is that we ſo highly value them, as to be ſervent and zealous in ſeeking them. Indifferency of Spirit was that which hindered this Angel and Church from
<hi>buying,</hi> they were lukewarm, and neither cold not hot; and unleſs this temper were removed, they could
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103338:112"/> not be made partakers of this heavenly commodity, as is before ſaid. So elſewhere the holy Ghoſt ſignifieth, that diligence and importunity is to be uſed, that we may get the wiſdom that is from above. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt after wiſdom, and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſure: then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledg of God,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1-6. On ſuch like accounts, and for ſuch like reaſons, this gaining Chriſt, and that moſt excellent proviſion in him, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and compared to <hi>buying.</hi> And we ſhall add no more to this ſecond particular, but come to the next formerly propoſed—<hi>Viz.</hi>

               <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 16-24. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.
17—25. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 18-27. So it is with many others alſo; When the glad tidings of the Goſpel are firſt declared to them, they are ready to wonder at thoſe gracious words; and they are unto them as a lovely Song of one that can play well on an Inſtrument, and hath a pleaſant voice; yea, poſſibly the Goſpel may have ſome impreſſion upon
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103338:117"/> them; and they are made willing to part with ſome evils thereby; and yet when this Goſpel ſheweth them the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of parting with all reproved, and beginneth to draw them out of their elements, they then forſake the Lord the fountain of living waters. How zealous did thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> appear to be who took ſhipping, and followed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as if they had been regardleſs of their own outward affairs and concernes! And how were they inquiring of Chriſt what they ſhould do that they might work the works of God, <hi>that they might have that meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth unto everlaſting life</hi>! And praying him,
<hi>Lord, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore give us the bread of life:</hi> And yet when he told them what it was, becauſe it did not anſwer their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but reproved them, and their other feeding, how many were offended at Chriſt, and went back, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more with him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 24-34-66. <hi>This is the condemnation, that lign is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds were</hi> (and were diſcovered by the light to be) <hi>evil: For every one that doth evil hateth the light neither cometh he to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved and diſcovered.</hi> Joh. 3. 19, 20. Let this be conſidered by us, that we miſcarry not alſo after the examples of others, which are recorded for our admonition.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that they that will have Chriſt, and the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches and righeouſneſs of him, muſt buy them, with ſelling all that they have, this ſheweth unto us the miſtake of many in their thoughts of the Doctrine of the Goſpel. How many are there that think and ſay, this Doctrine of the Goſpel is a ſmooth, eaſie Doctrine, a Doctrine of looſneſs, and licentiouſneſs: If, ſay they, Chriſt died for all, Then men may live as they liſt, and do whatſoever is right in their own eyes, and yet they ſhall be ſaved. It ſeemeth by their thus ſpeaking they conclude, thoſe that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103338:118"/> Chriſt died for may live as they liſt; And ſo the Elect, as they call them, for whom only, they ſay, he died, may do whatſoever is good in their own eyes. Oh miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſtake! How ignorant are ſuch perſons of this ſound Doctrine, which is a Doctrine according to godlineſs? This Doctrine indeed proclaimeth liberty to us, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to liberty, a gracious, and glorious liberty; only not to liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 13. It proclaimeth unto us a liberty from ſin, not to ſin: for this is a curſed liberty; and yet it is that which their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines make way for, who are enemies to the grace of God in Chriſt to the world of mankind, while they would lay it upon and charge others with it. But herein Chriſt's Goſpel meeteth with no other uſe in the world then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did while he was here in his perſonal miniſtration. The zealous ones amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> did falſly accuſe Chriſt with being a vicious perſon; the men of that generation, thoſe who were the men of the times then, they ſaid of the Son of Man,
<hi>Behold a gluttonous perſon, and a wine bibber, a friend of Publicanes and ſinners:</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of all her Children.</hi> All the Children of Chriſt and the Goſpel know, that this is but a ſlander. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 31-35. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 16-19. There is no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine beſides, that ſo ſheweth the vileneſs of ſin, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our being waſhed therefrom in the blood of Chriſt, as doth this Doctrine of the Goſpel: <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation to all men, hath appeared, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Titus 2. 11-14. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. Rom. 5. 18. with chap. 6. 1-3. But this ſlander of theirs is the iſſue of their ignorance and prejudice; and what better fruit can be expected from ſuch evil and bitter roots?</p>

This inſtruction may alſo ſhew unto us the great evil of thoſe that deny that Chriſt hath died for all, and by the grace of God taſted death for every man; for theſe render it impoſſible for the greateſt part of men to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that darable riches and righteouſneſs in Chriſt. The Doctrine of the Goſpel maketh the gate unto life ſtrait enough, and yet no ſtraiter then is needful; <hi>But theſe ſhut up the kingdom of Heaven againſt men, and neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer them that are entring to enter.</hi> The little finger of this Doctrine is heavier then the loyns of the Goſpel to the greateſt part of man kind. Nay, indeed as with reſpect to one part of men, there is no ſtraitneſs in the gate at all; and with reference to the other, and greateſt part, there is no gate open for them at all, were their doctrines as true, as they are counted by many: But theſe herein are falſe witneſſes of God, and like the evil ſpies that brought an evil report upon the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and thereby diſcouraged the hearts of many of their brethren: Take we heed and beware of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and pernicious doctrines that cauſe to err from the words of knowledg, and way of truth.—</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing we cannot have theſe heavenly commodities without buying, in ſelling all that we have; let us ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider the excellency of them, that we may be made willing to let go all things as lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now then in this Inſtruction here propounded, we ſhall ſpeak unto theſe three things contained therein, which may be uſefully, and profitably conſidered by us.—As to ſay.—</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That Chriſt's Angels and Churches may be blind, and ignorant of the excellency of Chriſt, and thoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in him.—</item>
               <item>2. That there is <hi>eye-ſalve</hi> prepared for ſuch blind ones alſo, wherewith anointing their eyes they may ſee.—</item>
               <item>3. That to the end they <hi>buy</hi> Chriſt, and that in him, it is neeful they anoint their eyes herewith, that they may ſee.—</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That Chriſt's Angels and Churches may ſo depart from him, as to become blind and ignorant of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, and of thoſe treaſures hid in him: Thus it appeareth here in this place, in which our Lord ſaith to the Angel, <hi>Thou art blind;</hi> and counſelleth every one that hath an ear, to hear what the ſpirit ſaith to the Churches; as intimating, this was ſpoken to them all for their admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and that it might ſo befall them alſo, if they did not look diligently leſt they failed of, or fell from the grace
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103338:119"/> of God. God's people may become fooliſh, and not know him, they may be ſottiſh children, and have no underſtanding. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22. Yea, the Paſtours may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brutiſh, and not ſeek the Lord. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 19-21. The blindneſs here ſpoken of is not the being deſtitute of natural, or artificial wiſdom, the wiſdom of this world; for this men may have, and yet be ſufficiently blind in this conſideration we have to ſpeal of, <hi>for the wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſs with God. Where is the wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the diſputer of this world? Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 19. and chap. 1. 18-21. But the blindneſs here ſpoken of is, a being without the wiſdom that is from above, a being deſtitute of ſpiritual underſtanding; And ſo this Angel was blind, if not wholly, yet in a great meaſure; and in ſo great a meaſure as that our Saviour, the wiſdom of God ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that he was blind. Thoſe that are watchmen amongſt God's people, and who have high conceits of themſelves for knowledg, and piety, may yet have their eyes blinded with darkneſs. <hi>His watchmen,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>are blind;</hi> they are all ignorant; there may be blind guides, blind leaders of the blind, and how ſad is it when it is thus? <hi>Then ſurely their leaders cauſe them to err, and they that are led of them are deſtroyed?</hi> Iſa
56. 10. &amp; 3. 12. &amp; 9. 16. Matt. 15. 14. &amp; 23. 24. Jer. 2. 8. This Angel and Church might be in ſuch a condition as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of when he ſaith, He that lacketh theſe things (to wit, theſe great and precious promiſes miniſtred in and with the Goſpel; he in whom theſe are not, and abound not, dwell not richly; ſo as he addeth not to his faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godlineſs; and to godlineſs brotherly-kindneſs; and to brotherly-kindneſs charity; ſuch an one) is blind, and cannot ſee afarr off;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103338:120"/> he is poreblind: He may ſee ſome things near hand, but he is ſo blind he cannot ſee theſe things afarr off; he cannot ſee within the vail; he cannot ſee into Heaven where Chriſt is, nor thoſe things above where he ſitteth. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12.
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. Nor that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: And the reaſon of that blindneſs the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, and of this our Saviour chargeth this Angel and Church with, and reproveth them for, may be one; to wit, the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they were purged from their old ſins; letting ſlip what they heard from the beginning, to wit, that Chriſt died for the ſins of
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo of all men, according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures: Whereby Chriſt purged our old ſins, our firſt ſin, and ſinfulneſs, and through the knowledge whereof he waſhed our hearts from an evil conſcience, and ſpake peace to us and made us free: Had they kept this in an hearty believing remembrance, they had been ſaved, and preſerved from this blindneſs; and they ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Son, and in the Father: But receiving and entertaining a forgetfulneſs of this purgation, and of the means whereby it was effected, this contracted blindneſs to them. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4-8, 9. 1

<hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24-27. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. And this blindneſs of theirs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and was evident in two things: (and wherever theſe things are found, doubtleſs they are in ſome meaſure blind, and ſo in the condition of this Angel and Church) That is to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were grown lukewarm, as hath been ſaid, and did not ſo perceive the preciouſneſs of Chriſt as to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſervent in ſeeking after him, that they might win him, and be found in him: In letting ſlip the word of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103338:120"/> the beginning of Chriſt, the viſion of all, the God of this world had blinded their minds, that they did not ſo diſcern the beauty and comelineſs of Chriſt, as to cry after the knowledge and injoyment of him, and thoſe ſpiritual and eternal bleſſing in him; but they were grown remiſs, and indifferent: Thoſe that in ſeeing ſee, and keep in their view the excellency of Chriſt, are far from this diſtemper: To them that believe, he is precious, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. As new born babes deſire the breaſt, ſo they earneſtly deſire after more acquaintance with, injoyment of, and conformity unto him. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 2-4. And they are even ſick of love, and reſtleſs in their ſpirits after him: As the hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo their ſouls pant after him; they are even conſumed with deſire, and nothing will ſatisfy them but him: Whom have they in Heaven but he? and there is none on earth they deſire beſides him. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
42. 1, 2. &amp; 84. 1, 2. &amp; 63. 1, 2. &amp; 73. 25. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3-5. Their ſoul followeth hard after him, and their zeal even conſumeth them, and leadeth them to long, and inwardly breath after, and earneſtly luſt for him, who is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among Ten thouſands. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 3-8. With their ſoul they deſire him in the night, yea, with their ſpirits within them they ſeek him early. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 7-9. But contrarily, it is a certain evidence of blindneſs, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are grown ſo heartleſs and indifferent, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves, without him; and deny, or delay to give entertainment to him; when he ſtandeth at the door, and knocketh for admiſſion, as it was with theſe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. When men by obſerving lying vanities forſake him, and will none of him; when they prefer their works, riches, righteouſneſs, luſts and vanities, before him, and thoſe excellent treaſures in him, which only will truly inrich, clothe, ſatisfy, and adorn them; it appeareth evidently to him who knoweth all things, and to thoſe who have
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103338:121"/> their underſtandings opened, that ignorance and darkneſs hath blinded their eyes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 13, 14,
15. So much the Apoſtle ſaith concerning the <hi>Galatians: O fooliſh Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſet forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. It was evident that they were become fooliſh and blind, and that ſome perſon or perſons had caſt a miſt before their eyes, in that they were removed from Chriſt, and that grace in him; and did ſeek righteouſneſs, and ſanctification elſewhere, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perfect by the fleſh that which was begun by the ſpirit: When Chriſt was firſt diſplayed before them, he was then ſo excellent in their eyes, that they turned unto him from their ſins and idols; they did run well; for they did run unto him for all wiſdom, righteouſneſs, and ſtrength, becauſe of the Lord his God, and for the Holy one of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had glorified him. Oh then what bleſſedneſs did they meet with, and ſpeak of, in Chriſt! But afterwards letting ſlip the preaching of the Croſs, they turned again to weak and beggerly elements: And on this account the Apoſtle calleth them fooliſh ones, blind ones, and bewitched perſons; it appeared evidently their eyes were blinded, or otherwiſe they would have kept their firſt eſteem, and high prizing of Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1-5. &amp; 4. 8, 9, 13-15. &amp; 5. 7. with,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1-5. So alſo it was too much with this Angel and Church; they were blind, and it appeared that they were ſo, in that they ſhut out Chriſt when he knocked for entrance, and undervalued him: And we may ſafely conclude as with reſpect to our ſelves, and others, that blindneſs hath happened to us in a great meaſure, when our love to, and zeal for Chriſt is gone, and we are grown luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. It appeared alſo and was evident that they were
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103338:121"/> blind, becauſe together with their low eſteem of Chriſt, they had high thoughts, and conceits of themſelves, and of the goodneſs of their condition without him, and of their knowledge, parts, gifts, righteouſneſs, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity: <hi>They ſaid they were rich, and increaſed with goods, and had need of nothing;</hi> when as in truth it was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with them; <hi>for they were wretched and miſerable,</hi> &amp;c. They conceited they knew, and were ready to ſay they were wiſe, and the Law of the Lord was with them, when as indeed they were brutiſh and fooliſh. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7, 8. This was an undoubted evidence of their blindneſs, and is ſo of any man's, when he beginneth to be ſo well thoughted, and highly conceited of himſelf. Truly thoſe that walk in the light as God is in the light, they are helped to ſee, and bewail their ſhortneſs in every thing; and while they hear ſongs, even glory to the righteous, they are ready to cry out, our leanneſs, our leanneſs, woe unto us, the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherouſly with us; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherouſly. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 16. They are ready with ſhame to complain, that they are more brutiſh then man; and that they have not the underſtanding of a man; that they have neither learned wiſdome, nor have the knowledge of the holy. <hi>Prov.</hi> 32: 2, 3.
<hi>Job</hi> 26. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 19-12. They are ready to conſeſs and acknowledge, that they have not yet attained, neither are already perfect (as to attainment) but they follow after, if that they may apprehend that for which alſo they are apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus: They count not themſelves to have apprehended, <hi>&amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3. 11-16. Yea, the nearer the light they come, the more they ſee their vileneſs, readineſs to halt, inſufficiency to any thing that is good, uncleanneſs and pollution; ſo that they even abhorr themſelves in duſt, and aſhes; and cry out as perſons undone, becauſe of their great uncleanneſs,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103338:122"/> and manifold defilements: Their comelineſs is even turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into corruption, and they retain no ſtrength at all. 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 17-19. <hi>Job.</hi> 40. 4, 5. &amp;
42. 5, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 3-5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 8-16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.
17. As perſons made ſenſible of their ſhortneſs of the knowledge of him, and conformity unto him, they cry out; Open our eyes, give us underſtanding, teach us thy law graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; unite our hearts to fear thy name: Waſh us throughly from all our iniquities, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi>
119. 18-20. 33. 34-37. 129, 130. &amp; 130. 7, 8. &amp; 86. 7. It is therefore an evidence without controverſy, of mens great blindneſs and ignorance, when they have ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening conceit of themſelves, and of their knowledge, fulneſs, and ſufficiency, of their goodneſs and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as had this Angel and Church. Such perſons are like to the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, who were very pure in their own eyes, and had ſome kind of righteouſneſs, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared righteous before men: They had very high thoughts of themſelves, as if they where whole, and knowing perſons, and needed nothing; hence ſome of them ſay, <hi>are we blind alſo?</hi> As if it were an hainous thing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo of them.
<hi>Job.</hi> 9. 40. And one of them in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>Maſter, thus ſaying thou reprocheſt us alſo.</hi> As if it were a reproch to them to be ſuſpected as, or reproved for, being guilty of ſuch evils as were juſtly charged upon them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 44, 45. Thus alſo it is with many perſons that have had ſome underſtanding of the grace of God in Chriſt to mankind; as they begin to leſſen, and abate in their love to, and eſteem of Chriſt; ſo together here-with, they think unſoberly of themſelves, and are puffed up with conceits of their knowledge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and upright-heartedneſs; when as indeed this is nothing elſe then the fruit and evidence of their blindneſs and ignorance. Nay generally, ſuch as deſerve moſt to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103338:122"/> be reproved and blamed; and who give too frequently occaſion to the adverſary to ſpeak reprochfully of that worthy name called upon them, they are the forwardeſt in proclaiming their own goodneſs, and moſt tender of their reputation, and moſt incenſed againſt ſuch as are ſeeking and purſuing their good: As if the God of this world had blinded their minds, that they might the more ſecurely go on to their own deſtruction. And ſurely, as hath been ſaid, ſuch like goodly thoughts of themſelves; as were found with this Angel and Church, are an evident demonſtration that they are blind; and profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be full, and wiſe, they become ſtill more fooliſh and brutiſh: And expoſe themſelves to that great judgment of being ſpued out of the mouth of Chriſt.—</p>
            <p>And this conſideration that Chriſt's Angels and Churches may, after they have been inlightned into the knowledge of the truth, become blind again, as it ſared with this Angel and Church, may be of uſefulneſs to us all.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. To admoniſh us, not therefore to follow any as our guides, becauſe they are of the Church of Chriſt, yea, though they are Angels therein; for it is poſſible, though their eyes have been opened, yet by letting ſlip what they have heard, they may become blind again: <hi>And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</hi> Matt. 15. 14. Nay, it is certain they are blind if they be grown lukewarm, and remiſs, and ſit looſe from Chriſt, or ſhut him out; and together herewith are lifted up with pride, and high thoughts of their knowledge, fullneſs, attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Concerning ſuch it may be ſaid; hearken not to the words of theſe Prophets, they make you vain, <hi>they ſpeak a viſion of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi> Jer. 23. 15, 16. When once the viſion of all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103338:123"/> is unto them as the words of a book that is ſealed; and they have no knowledge of, or delight in it: When Chriſt, who is therein witneſſed of, and lifted up, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed, and ſleighted by them; and they conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well enough without him; it is a certain evidence and ſign that they are blind, their eyes are covered and cloſed; and how ſhould we then ſafely follow them? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.
12-16. &amp; 29. 9-11. Let us remember them who have ſpoken unto us the word of the Lord, and follow their faith unto whom Chriſt is precious; and conſider them, the end of whoſe converſation, in all they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed unto, is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame, yeſterday, and today, and for ever.</hi> Heb. 13. 7-9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seeing they may become blind who have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened into the knowledge of the truth; let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelves; and ſearch and try our hearts and ways, whither it be not ſo with us: Theſe things are written for our inſtruction and learning, upon whom the ends of the world are come: Let us not think we have ever the more a good underſtanding, becauſe we think and ſay, <hi>we are rich,</hi> but rather ſuſpect our ſelves, if ſuch a vain thought lodge within us: <hi>For if any man think he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know: But if any man love God in Chriſt, if his heart cleave unto him with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame is known and owned of him.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 1-3. There is indeed a great boaſt of knowledge in the world in theſe laſt days, and men have high conceits of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of their riches and fullneſs; but, Oh that, notwithſtanding their crying up of their knowledge, and the goodneſs of their condition, it appear not at laſt that they are blind, and fooliſh, and deſtitute of love to Chriſt, and that <hi>gold and white raiment</hi> which he hath to ſell! Yea, let us all be jealous of our ſelves; and let us not be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear: Doubtleſs if once we think we are
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103338:123"/> Lords, and come not continually unto Chriſt, we are not ſuch perſons as we conceive our ſelves to be, but darkneſs hath blinded our eyes: And if we be convinced it be thus with us; and to the end we may know what condition we are in.—</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be we all exhorted to liſten to the counſel here giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto us by this wiſe and gracious counſellour, to wit, let us
<hi>anoint our eyes with Eye-ſalve, that we may ſee:</hi> And that we may ſo do, is to be ſeen in the next place—<hi>viz.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> alſo prepared for them that are blind, wherewith <hi>anointing</hi> their eyes they may ſee. We have ſeen before, that there is <hi>gold tried in the fire, for thoſe that are wretched, and miſerable, and poor: And white raiment for naked ones, wherewith they may be clothed, ſo as the ſhame of their nakedneſs may not appear.</hi> And here is ſignified to us, that there is <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> alſo to be had, to cure and heal the blindneſs of the eyes. In Chriſt, as declared in the teſtimony, there is all compleatneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, for ſupplying all our wants, and healing all our diſeaſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
103. 1-3. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 3. 9, 10. In that feaſt which is prepared by means of the marraige of our Nature to the Divine Nature, in the perſon of the word, the Son of God; there is a compleat proviſion for us poor, empty, miſerable, diſeaſed creatures: And hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to are invited, not only the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, but the blind alſo: For therein there is cure and healing for them. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 1-4-8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 16-21. The father hath ſo loved the Son, that he hath given all things into his hand, into his poſſeſſion, and diſpoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35. And though it be marvellous in our eyes, and hath been wondred at, that the
<hi>blind</hi> ſhould receive their ſight; yet it is eaſy with him unto whom all power is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en both in Heaven, and on earth. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 30,
31. &amp;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103338:124"/> 28. 18. Though there be no healing medicine among men, yet he can heal this diſeaſe alſo, no word is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 12-17.</p>
            <p>But before we come to ſpeak to this Inſtruction parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, it may be uſeful to conſider and give Anſwer unto this Queſtion, which may reaſonably be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doth the Amen, the faithful and true witneſs, counſel this Angel and Church to buy of him Gold, and White raiment; and not alſo this Eye-ſalve? Wherefore is the Phraſe here altered? He had ſaid. I counſel thee to buy, as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the two former particulars; and now the Phraſe is changed, and here he ſaith, anoint thine eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What may the Reaſon hereof be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In general we may ſay, doubtleſs there is good reaſon for it, though it be hidden from me, who am ſuch a babe, and ſo unskilful in theſe things: For there is not the leaſt word, variation, or change, made uſe of in the Scripture by the Spirit of God, but it is ſo uſed and done in much wiſdom, and upon weighty accounts, all the words of whoſe mouth are in righteouſneſs, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en forth in judgment: And therefore oftentimes called judgment, and judgments. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 4.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 5. And hence I believe, though I may not ſee wherefore, that there is good cauſe for the altering the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here in this part of the counſel: And had I more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed mine eyes with this
<hi>eye-ſalve,</hi> I might have better ſeen the cauſe, ſo as to have been helpful to others, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſatisfactory Anſwer hereto. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly; I conceive, as hath been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before, that though this part of the counſel be placed laſt in the order of words, yet it is firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103338:124"/> and obſerved in order of nature; for how can we ſo highly value this <hi>gold and white raiment,</hi> as to buy, in ſelling all that we have, unleſs we firſt in ſome meaſure ſee the worth and value thereof? Now, therefore this <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> is brought unto us preventingly, and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to <hi>anoint our eyes</hi> herewith, before it be required of us to buy: The eye muſt firſt be opened, before we can turn from <hi>darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Acts 26. 18. It cannot reaſonably be expected from us, that we ſhould forſake all we have, or be ſaved from our ſins and idols, until our eyes be opened, and we ſee, and have found this treaſure: Hence that call, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved,</hi> to wit, from your iniquities and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; but firſt, <hi>look unto me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.
22. <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is like unto a treaſure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found he hideth; and for joy thereof goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field:</hi> But firſt, before he buyeth, in ſelling all that he hath, he findeth it, and diſcerneth and perceiveth the excellency of it, ſo as it cauſeth joy unto him. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 44-46.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 16. So here; this Angel and Church is inſtructed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and before buying to <hi>anoint their eyes;</hi> and then, and to that end, that they buy thoſe unſearchable riches, and invaluable treaſures of Chriſt Jeſus, which are here ſet before them, and the excellency whereof is propounded to them.—</p>
            <p>Now then in ſpeaking unto this Inſtruction, we ſhall inquire into and ſhew.—</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What are <hi>theſe eyes</hi> of theirs here ſpoken of, and which they are called upon to anoint?—</item>
               <item>2. What is <hi>this Eye-ſalve</hi> here commended to them, wherewith they ſhould anoint their <hi>eyes?</hi>—</item>
               <item>3. What is this <hi>anointing the eyes</hi> which is here called for, and counſelled unto?—</item>

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:103338:125"/> 4. Shew, That this is prepared for them, and brought unto them, that they may anoint their eyes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.—</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. What are <hi>theſe eyes</hi> of theirs here ſpoken of, and which they are called upon to anoint:—</p>
            <p>To this we may ſay; Not their outward or bodily eyes: For here the holy Spirit ſpeaketh of ſpiritual things, as hath in ſome meaſure been ſhewn. And it appeareth their blindneſs was not upon the bodily eye, becauſe they would then have known it: But of theſe he ſaith, <hi>thou knoweſt not that thou art blind.</hi> They were inſenſible of their miſery; which very rarely, if ever, perſons are of their outward blindneſs; unleſs ſuch as are wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of judgment: But there are other eyes, to wit, thoſe of the ſoul, the mind, or underſtanding of a man; that faculty of the ſoul whereby a man may ſee, when it is opened, ſuch things as the bodily eye cannot diſcerne: And of theſe inward eyes our Saviour here ſpeaketh: <hi>Their underſtandings were darkened.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. <hi>Their minds were blinded.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. &amp; 3. 14. Theſe eyes are called, <hi>the eyes of the underſtanding.</hi> Epheſ. 1.
18. Of theſe <hi>eyes</hi> our Saviour ſpeaketh, when he ſaith to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples; <hi>perceive ye not yet, neither underſtand? Have ye your hearts yet hardened? Having eyes ſee ye not?—How is it that you do not underſtand?</hi> Mark 8. 17-21.—And of theſe eyes the Apoſtle meaneth, when he ſaith to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians; who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified, among you?</hi> Gal. 3. 1. He was never cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the view of their bodily eyes, for he was crucified at
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but he was ſet forth crucified before the eyes of their underſtanding in the glorious Goſpel. Theſe eyes may be ſufficiently blind and dark as with reſpect to ſpiritual things, though the bodily eye be never ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103338:125"/> and though a man may be rich in the knowledg and ſight of natural or moral things: So it was with this Angel and Church; and therefore this gracious and faithful Counſeller inſtructeth, and counſelleth them to <hi>anoint their eyes,</hi> to wit, of the underſtanding, with this <hi>Eye-ſalve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What is this <hi>Eye ſalve</hi> here ſpoken of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, by this faithful and true Witneſs?</p>
            <p>This alſo is to be underſtood in a ſpiritual conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and hereby is not meant the Wiſdom of this world, or of the Princes of this world; for this will not open the eyes of the blind into the knowledge of the Croſs of Chriſt, and the ends and virtues thereof, nor into the preaching thereof: But theſe things are fooliſhneſs to them that ſeek after this wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18-23. <hi>The natural and animal man receiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; nor can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. And hence the Holy Ghoſt hath inſtructed thoſe that are wiſe with this ſeeming wiſdom, <hi>to become fools, that they might be wiſe,</hi> as before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
18-20. and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the believers to beware of Philſophy, <hi>Col.</hi>

               </gap> uſe of it, in declaring the teſtimony of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. and Chapter 2. 1-5.</p>
            <p>But by this <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> is meant, the Word of Truth, the Goſpel of our Salvation, eſpecially the firſt branch of it; in which is declared to us the ſufferings of Chriſt, and what he hath thereby effected for us in himſelf, and obtained into himſelf, and is become.</p>
            <p>And that this is meant by the <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, may appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the name put upon it, and that by this ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to whom this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> was ſent and ſignified; it is by him called <hi>an action,</hi> and the
<hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:103338:126"/> So the Apoſtle ſaith to the believers;
<hi>Ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an unction from the Holy one, and ye know all things;</hi> That is, they had received the truth, the word of truth, which appeareth to be the thing meant by that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>That which they had heard from the beginning,</hi> to wit, <hi>that Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scriptures and was buried, and roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 John 2. 20-24. with 1 Cor. 15. 1, 4. And ſo it is called the <hi>anointing;</hi> which is the very ſame thing, when he ſaith, <hi>The anointing ye have received of him abideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 2. 27. And in this teſtimony of Jeſus, the Holy Spirit, which is the Oyl wherewith Chriſt was anointed above his fellows, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent in the faithful declaration of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
38. Yea, becauſe this Goſpel was given forth by the Spirit; and becauſe the Spirit is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent with it; therefore it is eſpecially as now revealed) both called the miniſtration of the Spirit, and the Spirit, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 8. <hi>John</hi> 6. 63. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17.
<hi>John</hi> 7. 38, 39. &amp; 3. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 11.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. It appeareth alſo, that by this <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> is meant the Goſpel of Chriſt, or teſtimony of the Lord, becauſe this is that which openeth the eyes of the underſtanding, that men may ſee; for which purpoſe, and to which end, this Angel and Church is counſelled to uſe this <hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve:</hi> So it is ſaid, <hi>The teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wiſe the ſimple;</hi> to wit, opening their eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing to them that object, in knowing which they may be made wiſe:
<hi>And the commandment of the Lord</hi> (the old and new Commandment, the Goſpel of Chriſt) <hi>is pure, enlightening the eyes,</hi> Pſal. 19. 7,
8. So much the Prophet elſewhere alſo ſignifieth, when he ſaith,
<hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103338:126"/> of thy words</hi> (namely, the word of the beginning of Chriſt) <hi>giveth light,</hi> (to diſcover all things)
<hi>and it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth underſtanding</hi> (to wit, capacity for ſeeing)
<hi>unto the ſimple:</hi> It giveth both light and ſight, without both which a man cannot ſee; though a mans eyes be never ſo good, yet he cannot ſee in the dark. But this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lord is the <hi>medium</hi> for diſcovering all things; and this giveth capacity for diſcerning the things diſcovered alſo. So wonderful are the teſtimonies of the Lord, eſpecially in the firſt and fundamental things of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
119. 129, 130. So alſo the Apoſtle ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation is given in the knowledge, or doctrine of Chriſt, both for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of the underſtanding, and for diſcovering and revealing Chriſt, and all things in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17, 18. Certainly, as the power of the Lord was preſent with Chriſt to heal bodily diſeaſes and infirmities, to cure the deaf and blind, while he was here in his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miniſtration, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 17. So alſo the hand and power of the Lord, yea, his arm is put forth in and with this word, ſo as the preaching of the Croſs is the power of God for healing the diſeaſes of the Soul; for giving ſight to the blind minds of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.
20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 23, 24. Hence it is ſaid, That the Spirit of the Lord was upon Chriſt, becauſe the Lord anointed him to preach the Goſpel to the poor, and therewith to preach recovering of ſight to the blind, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. He is become a good Phyſician, and he giveth ſight to the blind, by anointing them with that oyl that is in the name of the Lord. And the Apoſtle when he was ſent to the people, and to the Gentiles, <hi>to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light,</hi> &amp;c. was ſent with this <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> to preach the firſt and great things of Gods Law to them; and ſo much he giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103338:127"/> 
               <hi>I continue,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to this day, witneſsing both to ſmall and great; ſaying none other thing, then thoſe which the Prophets and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come to paſs. That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles,</hi> Acts 26 17, 18-23. To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo he ſpeaketh to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chapter 3. 8, 9. <hi>Unto me is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, and to make all men ſee;</hi> to wit, in thus preaching: Thereby he made them ſee, that they might ſee. This was the
<hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> which is here commended unto us. Ignorant are they of the wonderfulneſs of the teſtimony of the Lord, and of its excellent uſefulneſs for converting and reſtoring the Soul, That call it the letter, and a dead letter, as if it were meet for nothing: When as indeed it is the power of God for ſaving men from their blindneſs, and ignorance, and from all their iniquities and idols; and they prove and experiment it ſo to be, that with the heart believe it: Hence it is called, not onely the Goſpel of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but the ſalvation of God alſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.
13. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 28. And as Chriſt is called the Light, both becauſe he diſcovereth all things to us faithfully, and openeth the eyes of the blind; So alſo the commandment is ſaid to be a lamp, and the law light; becauſe hereby all things are manifeſted; and this giveth underſtanding: Yea, herewith Chriſt is preſent unto the end of the world; and hereby he giveth light to them that are in darkneſs, <hi>John</hi> 1. 6-9. with
<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1-7. Jeſus Chriſt, in ſhewing unto his Apoſtles in the Scripture <hi>the things concerning himſelf;</hi> to wit, that he hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and riſen again from the dead the third day; then, and thereby opened unto them the Scriptures; and opened their underſtandings, that they might underſtand the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103338:127"/> Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25-27, 32, 44,
45-47. This then is the <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> wherewith they ſhould anoint their eyes, to wit, <hi>the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> (eſpecially in the firſt things of it) <hi>which is the ſpirit of prophecy,</hi> Rev. 19. 10. and the unction whereby they might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="3">3. What is this anointing the eyes here called for, and counſelled unto?</p>
            <p>Surely hereby is meant, a receiving this <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> and retaining it in the midſt of the heart; Or, as having reference to the Metaphor, a putting it upon the eye, and ſuffering it there to abide, and enter in, and take place; not reſiſting, or putting it away. Herein is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that this <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> is brought nigh in due time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men; yea, to ſuch alſo as have ſuffered a decay of thoſe things wrought in them by the glorious Goſpel: <hi>The word is nigh thee,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in thy mouth, and in thine heart; that is the word of faith which we preach.</hi> 'Tis brought nigh to men in the preaching of it, that it might be received and entertained by them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. Now that which is here required, is, that they ſhould anoint their eyes herewith, that they ſhould embrace it, and not put it away from them: This was the great evil found with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Apoſtles preached the Goſpel to them; and that which cauſed them to turn to the Gentiles, That when the word of God was ſpoken to them, they put it away from them, and would none of it: Had they entertained it, it would have opened their blind eyes; but they refuſed it, and rejected this word of ſalvation ſent to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 45, 46. The contrary hereto was required of this Angel and Church; Namely, that they would receive, and let that abide in them, which they had heard at the beginning; As 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20, 21-24. <hi>John</hi>
9. 11-15. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 44. As Salve will not cure any bodily infirmity or diſtemper,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103338:128"/> unleſs it be laid upon it, and applied thereto: So alſo it is needful, to the end our ſpiritual blindneſs may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and cured, that this <hi>Eye-ſalve, the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> be received and kept by us, and laid to our eyes, as it were, and ſuffered there to abide; according to what the Proverb ſaith: <hi>My ſon, attend to my words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thine ear unto my ſayings; let them not depart from thine eyes,</hi> (but apply them thereto as Salve) <hi>keep them in the midſt of thine heart; for they are life unto thoſe that find them, and medicine to all their fleſh,</hi> Prov. 4. 20-22. &amp; 3. 21-23. And ſo certainly that which is contained in this counſel, that they ſhould anoint their eyes, is like unto that; <hi>My ſon, keep my words, and lay up my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments with thee; keep my commandments, and live, and my law as the apple of thine eyes: Bind them upon thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, write them upon the table of thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 7. 1-4. <hi>John</hi> 14. 21-24. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 4, 5. The
<hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> then here called for, and counſelled unto, is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and keeping upon the eyes thoſe things they had heard from the beginning in the Goſpel of Chriſt; which would heal and cure their blind eyes, and help them to ſee and behold that which at preſent they were ignorant of, and unacquianted with, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 3. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi>
15. 2, 3, 4—</p>
            <p n="4">4. We come in the next place to ſhew, that this
<hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve</hi> is prepared for the blind, and brought nigh unto them in due time, that they might anoint their eyes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that they may ſee. This Goſpel hath been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed and preached from the beginning; The Spirit of Chriſt in the Prophets did teſtifie before-hand the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 9-11. And therewith God was converting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the ſoul from its wandrings and diſeaſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. But now the myſtery is ſo opened, as in former times it
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103338:128"/> was not. <hi>The myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began, is now revealed, and made manifeſt; and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlaſting God, made known to all nations for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16. 25, 26. And this Goſpel, as thus revealed, is in the Scriptures of truth preſerved amongſt his Angels and Churches, through the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Gods working, whereby they have great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage given unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. This is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and they are betruſted with it, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords thereof, that thereby they might anoint their eyes, and might <hi>ſhine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. Phil. 2, 15, 16.

3. 27. As God hath written unto us excellent things in counſels, and knowledge, even the great things of his Law; ſo in due time he is ſhewing them unto men, to them that have the Name of Chriſt called upon them eſpecially; and bringing nigh unto them, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to receive and embrace them; that the eyes of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103338:129"/> their underſtandings might be enlightened thereinto, and thereby, into all things needful to be known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them: Yea, and this Eye-ſalve may be had freely in its preventing operations; not onely without money and price, without worth and worthineſs; for ſo the Gold and White Raiment may be had, as hath been ſhewn; but alſo without buying. And we are not inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before is ſaid, to buy this <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> to part with any thing, before we <hi>anoint our eyes;</hi> but we are counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to receive, and apply this to our eyes freely, that we may ſee: And then, and ſo to buy thoſe unvaluable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures here commended to us.</p>

But what will they now have to ſay, who periſh for lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, eſpecially where the Scriptures are vouchſafed?

Conſider we the eaſineſs of his Yoke, and lightneſs of his Burden which he putteth upon us. His Commandment herein is not grievous; he doth not require we ſhould purge away our ſin by Sacrifice, or make our peace with God by any wiſdom or ſtrength of ours: He calleth not upon us to get and provide for our ſelves <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> or to go and ſeek it we know not where.

If he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us ſome hard thing, there had been reaſon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us to have done it, if poſſible; becauſe our good is ſo much concerned herein, and ours onely: For it doth not adventage him at all; how much rather when he ſaith, <hi>Anoint and ſee,</hi> Micah

And indeed this branch of the counſel may give anſwer unto, and remove a doubt, that may be, and ariſe in our jealous hearts, on the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this counſel given to ſuch wretched piteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as theſe were: For they might be ready to ſay,—</p>

This Counſellour threatneth to ſpue us out of his mouth, and telleth us that we are poor miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and ſpeaketh as if he were highly offended with us, and greatly incenſed againſt us: How can we then believe that he ſhould in earneſt propoſe to us ſuch enriching gold, and ſuch excellent raiment, as is here commended to us? Whence ſhould ſuch grace be to ſuch unworthy ill deſerving ones as we are? It is poſsible that that which he here calleth upon us to buy, is nothing elſe but counterfeit, and not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as he would perſwade us it is; how ſhall we know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be right gold, or ſuch excellent raiment, as it is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To give anſwer to ſuch a jealouſie, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious thought, this may be added; or however it is proper to purge it out of us.

But yet to the end we might be aſſured of, and ſatisfied in the goodneſs and reality of the Treaſures here commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us; before he requireth us to buy, he firſt, in order of nature, willeth us to <hi>anoint our eyes with this Eye-ſalve, that we may ſee.</hi> He might upon his own authority, as being our Lord, have commanded us to buy, and to have depended wholly upon his word for what he ſaith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing with our eyes; but he condeſcendeth to us in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103338:131"/> a more gracious way, and inſtructeth us to open our eyes that we might be ſatisfied. And in ſome ſort, though not fully, he dealeth with us as he did with <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he was ſo ſlow of heart to believe; yea, reſolved not to believe that Chriſt was raiſed again, except he ſaw ſuch things as might remove all doubtfulneſs out of him; our Saviour was then pleaſed to give him ſuch an evident demonſtration, and infallible proof of the truth of what he was doubtful concerning, that he crieth out, as one abundantly convinced of his former evil; <hi>My Lord, and my God:</hi> So in ſome ſort he dealeth here; though he preſenteth not himſelf to our bodily eyes, yet he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth us to anoint the eyes of our underſtanding, that we may ſee, and might no longer have any doubtfulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in us, <hi>John</hi> 1. 39-46.</p>
            <p>In this Inſtruction then let us conſider theſe two things which are needful to be ſpoken to.—</p>

               <item>1. What is that we ſhould anoint our eyes for, that we may ſee?</item>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. What is that we ſhould anoint our eyes for, that we may ſee? What is it that is needful to be ſeen by us? To this we may ſay, it is needful to our buying thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treaſures, to ſee—</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and that durable riches and righteouſneſs in him; and the means whereby he is become ſuch a rich treaſury and ſtore-houſe of all the fulneſs of grace and truth, that of his fulneſs we might receive, and grace for grace; to wit, his humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and becoming obedient to death, the death of the croſs; for all this is the price of his blood, and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſufferings for us. This is needful for us to ſee, even thoſe heavenly and bleſſed commodities that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103338:132"/> are here to be <hi>bought</hi> by his Angels and Churches; It is but a reaſonable thing we ſhould ſee what we are invited to buy in parting with all for; And Chriſt, and the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of him are diſcovered to us in, and by this <hi>eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve,</hi> the teſtimony of Jeſus, and we are thereby inabled to behold them. As well as alſo, here is ſhewn unto us the abaſement of Chriſt, where-through he hath obtained all things into his hand for us; here we may ſee the great ſufferings he indured for us; ſo the Apoſtle ſignifieth, that in this Goſpel, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was evidently ſet forth cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, before their eyes, the eyes of their ſouls.</hi> Gal. 3. 1.

So much the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſignifieth concerning the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that remained in darkneſs, when he ſaith; <hi>they have their underſtandings darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart; who being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over unto laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs;</hi> as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were pleaſurable unto them, but what is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 17-19. So the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the believing Gentiles ſaith, <hi>that in times paſt</hi> (namely when they were darkneſs) <hi>they walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the Prince of the power of the Air, the ſpirit that now worketh</hi> (rulingly, and prevailingly) <hi>in the children of diſobedience.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1, 2. with chap. 5. 8. But to this we may add more afterwards. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is needful that we ſee our ſins, and vanities, that we may be willing to part with, and relinquiſh them: and with this <hi>eye-ſalve</hi> in the teſtimony of Chriſt we may ſee:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103338:134"/> Therein all things that are reproved, are made manifeſt by the light; the light doth faithfully diſcover them in their right and proper colours, to the end we might ſtand up from them, and might flee from our iniquities and idols. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11-14. And indeed the holy Spirit, that breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this teſtimony, doth in, and with glorifying Chriſt, and diſcovering the tranſcendent excellency of him, ſhew unto us alſo the ſinfulneſs of ſin; and the emptineſs of all thoſe objects in which naturally we are ſeeking reſt; and on which we are placing our affections; that we might turn from our vanities unto him, who is worthy to be cleaved unto by us. So when the Lord by the Prophet ſaith,
<hi>Behold they are all vanity, their works are nothing, their molten images are wind and confuſion;</hi> He then addeth, <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 41. 27-29. &amp; 42. 1. The holy Spirit in glorifying Chriſt, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his things, and ſhewing unto us, doth therein, and therewith convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment; and teacheth the believers all things, and leadeth them into all truth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8-14. In bearing witneſs of Chriſt, and in his teſtimony, the holy Spirit ſheweth unto us the odiouſneſs of our ſins, that we might ſee, and behold it, that we might abhort and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them; in that God hath taken ſuch vengeance on them in the perſon of his ſon, who knew no ſin: Though God teſtified of him that he was his beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed, yet when but the guilt of our ſin was imputed to him, he ſpared him not, but condemned our ſin in his fleſh:
<hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruife him, He did put him to grief.</hi> Iſa.
61. 2. Rom. 8. 3-32. Iſa. 53. 10. This ſeen and beheld by us, would help us to abhorr it, and ſay, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> Rom. 6. 1-3. And here may we alſo ſee the neceſſity of our being waſhed here-from, in that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103338:135"/> ſuch a fountain through his blood for cleanſing us. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. And it was his very end in being manifeſt, that he might take away our ſins. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5.
<q>He bare our ſins in his own body on the tree</q> (not that we might live any longer thereto, but)
<q>that we being dead to ſin, might live to righteouſneſs.</q> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1, 2. and chap. 2. 24. And in his croſs and teſtimony, we may alſo ſee the vanity of our idols, and our vileneſs in ſerving them; that we might turn there-from to God, to ſerve the living and true God. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9, 10. Here we may ſee the brutiſhneſs of our wiſdome.
<q>Now is the Judgment of this world, ſaith our Saviour:</q> Here you may take a view, and have a diſcovery of it, in that thoſe that were Princes of the World for wiſdom, crucified the Lord of glory; and were alſo, before his hour was come, the greateſt enemies to him; and thought that their taking him out of the way, and killing him, would much have tended to their ſecurity, when as, on the contrary, it brought, and haſtened deſtruction upon them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 47, 48. With <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 39-41. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.
45-49. Here may we ſee the unprofitableneſs of our works of righteouſneſs; in that he only could, and hath brought in by his death, and reſurrection, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs; and there was no other way for the compleating it for us;
<q>for if righteouſneſs could have come by the law, or by any other way whatſoever, then Chriſt hath died in vain.</q> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.
21. The Holy Ghoſt, ſaith our Saviour,
<q>ſhall convince the world of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</q> namely, he ſhall ſhew and evidence the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of all our works of righteouſneſs; and of all righteouſneſs according to the law; and that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not come by the works or ſacrifices thereof; in that he is gone to the Father, and we ſee him no more: He cometh no more down to ſuffer, or offer ſacrifice, but
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103338:135"/> his ſacrifice is accepted of God, ſo as he hath ſet him down on his own right hand. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 10. with.
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 1. 2. 11. 12. and he hath prepared righteouſneſs for all men, without the law, as hath been ſaid. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20-22. here we may alſo ſee the vanity and helpleſneſs of the riches of this world; in that we were not redeemed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things, as Silver and Gold:
<q>They that truſt in their riches, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their wealth; none of them can by any means redeem his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor give to God a ranſome for his own ſoul.</q> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 6, 7. Here alſo we may ſee the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and worthleſneſs of all the glory and honour of this world, in that our Lord Jeſus neither had, nor would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it: But he was rejected and deſpiſed of men,
<q>a worm and no man, a reproch of men, and deſpiſed of the people: All they that ſaw him laught him to ſcorn, they did ſhoot out the lip, they did ſhake the head. </q>
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.
2-4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 6, 7, 8. Nor had he, nor did he ſeek for, the favour and friendſhip of this world, but the world hated him, becauſe he teſtified of it, that the works thereof were evil. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 7. &amp;
15. 18-20.—</p>
            <p>Yea, in and by this one thing, by this unction, we may know all things that are needful to be known by us, and ſee them in their right colours: Hence the Apoſtle determined to know nothing in and unto all things,
<hi>but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. And it is needful we ſhould know the vileneſs of our ſins, and the vanity and unprofitableneſs of all thoſe objects on which naturally we are placeing our affections; and in which we have been ſeeking reſt, and ſatisfaction to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.—</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was needful for them to ſee themſelves, and to ſee what manner of condition they were in; and what
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103338:136"/> manner of perſons they were: And to this end, that they might ſee this, needful it was they ſhould anoint their eyes with this Eye-ſalve, that they might behold themſelves, and know what ſtate they were in: They were at preſent very much miſtaken; they thought their condition was very good, and that they were ſo happy that they needed nothing, but this was the fruit of their blindneſs and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; for had they viewed themſelves in the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, they might have perceived it was far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with them. And indeed this is generally the fruit of mens blindneſs; they are many times pure in their own eyes, who are not waſhed from their filthineſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 12, 13. Such fools are men, that all their own ways are clean in their own eyes. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 2. And they who have not the love of God in them, yet think that eternal life appertaineth to them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39-42. It is therefore a very ignorant and falſe ſaying of thoſe men, who tell us, that what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the believing <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel was received by them, to wit,
<q>that they were the children of wrath by nature even as others.</q> 
               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. Is only meant and ſpoken of what they were in their own apprehenſion and imagination: For they who are furtheſt off from the light do leaſt of all know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And are moſt ready to be highly thoughted of themſelves, while yet they are moſt miſerable: Who were more confident of the goodneſs of their condition, then were the
<hi>Phariſees:</hi> who yet generally were furtheſt off from the kingdom of God, further off then were the <hi>Pulicans</hi> and Harlots. <hi>Matt.</hi>
21. 31, 32. &amp; chap. 23. Yea, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who includeth himſelf in the former ſaying,
<q>as one who was by nature a Child of wrath even as others; yet did not think ſo, when he was fooliſh,</q> and while he was ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, but had confidence in the fleſh, and thought himſelf alive, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103338:136"/> in a good and ſafe condition.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4-7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. And ſo it is more generally true: Such as kill, ſteal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, ſwear falſly, and burn incenſe to other Gods, will yet cry, the temple of the Lord are we, until they are convinced by the light of Gods teſtimony. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4—10. Such can in words make their boaſt of God, and call him father, who are of their father the Devil; and ſay, they hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, as well as any others: And call their doing the works of the fleſh, their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and weakneſſes, and that they are herein like to <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith,
<q>the evil I would not, that do I; in which they lie, and ſpeak not the truth; and yet thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves. </q> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.
17-24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 41-44. And, as hath been ſaid, this Angel and Church were greatly deceived, and did deceive themſelves, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to be ſomething when they were nothing. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3. And it was therefore needful for them, and is ſo for us alſo, to know our ſelves, and our eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And this is made known to us, and we may ſee it in and by this <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> this teſtimony of Jeſus, in and by which all things are diſcovered, and made manifeſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.
13, 14. He that is an hearer of the word of truth, and not a doer, he hath this great advantage given him in hearing, that he may ſee and behold himſelf:
<q>He that is an hearer only is like unto a man beholding his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural face in a glaſs: For he beholdeth himſelf, and ſeeth what manner of perſon he is, though he liketh not the diſcovery which is there given of him; and therefore he goeth his way, and then forgetteth what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was, the which before he was inabled to ſee by that glaſs.</q> 
               <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22-24. He that doth evil hath, in and by the light, while it is vouchſafed, a diſcovery made of himſelf, and of his works, to the end he might continue beholding, and ſo cleanſe himſelf from what is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103338:137"/> reproved. <hi>That he might turn from darkneſs to light, and love light more then darkneſs;</hi> but in going on to do evil, to make a trade of it, <hi>he hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> for he is convinced of the impartiality of the light in its diſcovery: And for ſuch folly he is condemned while he perſiſteth therein. <hi>John</hi> 3.
19, 20. In this light then let us behold our ſelves; and with this Eye-ſalve let us anoint our eyes, that we may know our ſelves: This is a needful leſſon to be learned by us, to know our ſelves; but not the firſt, as many through miſtake ſay: But firſt, it is needful to know Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and him crucified,</hi> as declared in the Goſpel; and therein, and therewith we may know our ſelves. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1-4. with chap. 12. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>We our ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fooliſh; we did not know Chriſt, nor God in him, nor our ſelves, nor any thing rightly; but he ſaved us here-from by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt: Even by diſcovering to us, and cauſing to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us his kindneſs, and love in Chriſt to man-word.</hi> Titus 3. 3-5. He that is an unbeliever, and unlearned, an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant perſon, when he cometh amongſt them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, that plainly and to edification declare the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt; and in this light he beholdeth himſelf, ſo as he will fall down—and report, that God is in ſuch declares of a truth. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3, 24, 25. <hi>For the word of God, the Goſpel of Chriſt, is quick and powerful; and ſharper then any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow; and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> Heb. 4. 12. Therein then let us ſee and know our ſelves, and behold what condition we are in, that if we be like this Angel and Church, we may
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103338:137"/> learn to be zealous, and repent. And this which hath been ſpoken, ſhall ſuffice to the firſt inquiry here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be conſidered, to wit, <hi>What ſhould they anoint their eyes for, that they might ſee?</hi> And now we come to the ſecond,
<hi>viz.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Why is it needful to our buying, that we anoint our eyes with this Eye-ſalve, that we may ſee:</hi>—</p>
            <p>To this, in what we have ſaid before, we have ſpoken in ſome meaſure, and ſhall therefore be the briefer in what we ſhall further ſpeak to this Enquiry.—And ſo—</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is needful to our buying, that we anoint our eyes with this <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> that we may ſee; becauſe the ſight of thoſe things that are before ſpoken to, is very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to move and prevail with us, to receive this bleſſed and needful counſel here given to us, and to buy thoſe heavenly commodities here propoſed to, and ſet before us. The object, and ſight of the eye, was occaſionally the in let to our miſery and calamity at firſt. <hi>When the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe; ſhe took of the fruit thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 3. 6. So now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the objects of the eyes, which are preſented before us in the Goſpel, are forcible to perſwade us, and make us willing to come unto, and cloſe with Chriſt, when the eye of the Soul is opened with this
<hi>Eye-ſalve.</hi> The eye affecteth the heart, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 51. It inclineth the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and maketh us willing to buy that, which while we are in ignorance and blindneſs, we care not for, nor know how duely to prize and value.—As to ſay parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
            <p>While we anoint our eyes with this <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> and ſee, and continue looking upon the preciouſneſs of the Bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as it is diſcovered to us in this teſtimony; and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103338:138"/> his beauty and glory by means thereof. While we behold this Gold, this enriching Gold, and ſee, and conſider how it hath been tried in the fire, and how proper it is to make us truly rich; and how certainly and infallibly it enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that have it, this is apt and powerful to draw the love and heart thereto, and to cauſe us to covet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: As it is a powerful Cord to us naturally to draw our hearts to the riches of this world, to behold and ſee them with our eyes; As he confeſſed, who ſaid; <hi>When I ſaw two hundred ſhekels of ſilver, and a wedge of gold—then I coveted them, and took them,</hi> Joſh. 7. 21. 1 John 2.
15, 16. So when we ſee in this Glaſs this excellent Gold, the price whereof is above Rubies, yea above all the riches of this world, it is a forceable motive to engage our hearts to ſeek to be made partakers hereof. <hi>If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the gift of God,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me to drink, thou wouldſt ask,</hi> &amp;c. John 4.
10. How did the knowledge and conſideration of this better and enduring ſubſtance in Heaven, make the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> willing, in the days of their firſt Illumination, to <hi>take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, and to endure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and ſhame, and to be companions of them that were ſhamefully intreated:</hi> Heb. 10. 32-34. What bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did the
<hi>Galatians</hi> ſpeak of? And how did they turn from idols to God: And how ready would they have been, if it had been poſſible to have plucked out their eyes, and given them unto them that were inſtruments of preaching Chriſt unto them, when he was evidently ſet forth before their eyes in the teſtimony of Jeſus? They were willing then to part with all for his ſake,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. &amp; 4. 13-15. And was it not the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, that made the Apoſtle willing to <hi>ſuffer the loſs of all things, even of thoſe things alſo that formerly were gainful to him; and to count them but dung,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103338:138"/> that he might gain him, and be found in him?</hi> Phil. 3. 7-9. And to this very end, <hi>That a nation he knew not, and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that knew not him, might run unto him,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Behold me, behold me:</hi> As intimating, That the ſeeing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him is very powerful and prevalent to overcome, and perſwade us to cloſe with and embrace him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 5. &amp; 65. 1. And ſo the beholding and ſeeing this <hi>White Raiment,</hi> and the excellent and uſeful nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, is proper and powerful to incline us to ſeek that we may have it, that we may be clothed therewith, that ſo the ſhame of our nakedneſs may not appear, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4-9. Doubtleſs the beholding with the eyes of the underſtanding, that plenteouſneſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in him, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins; thoſe Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge hid in him; that everlaſting Righteouſneſs brought in by, and treaſured in him; that eternal Redemption obtained by his Bloud; that fulneſs of Grace, Truth, Spirit, and all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to life and godlineſs prepared in him; that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life given us in him: As theſe things are diſcovered to us in the teſtimony, and his compleat and unparallell d comelineſs and amiableneſs by means hereof, it would enamour our hearts on him, and inflame us with love to him; and even make us ſick of Love, and unſatisfied in our deſires, till we more know him, win him, and be found in him; yea, <hi>till we ſee as we are ſeen, and know as we are known, and be ever with him,</hi> Cant. 5.
10-16. &amp; 2. 3—5. <hi>Truly the light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the ſun,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 7. But how much more pleaſant and alluring is it, to behold <hi>this Pearl of great price,</hi> this Sun of Righteouſneſs, this Robe of Salvation, this excellent one, who is <hi>fairer then the children of men;</hi> yea, who is the true God, and eternal life! And how powerful is the ſight of him, to keep us from our ſins and idols: 1 John 5. 20, 21—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:103338:139"/> So alſo the ſeeing our ſins and idols, as diſcovered in his Croſs and Teſtimony, is very powerful to move us to caſt them away, and part with them, as hath been alſo in part ſignified before: There ſin is rendred moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſinful, and our idols moſt evidently unprofitable and vain: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Whoſoever abideth in Chriſt,</hi> in the ſight and knowledge of him, as appeareth by the oppoſition, <hi>ſinneth not:</hi> Though ſin be in him, and moving for ſervice, yet he doth not commit it; He doth not willingly yield up his mind or members to the ſervice thereof: And on the other hand,
<hi>Whoſoever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, hath not ſeen him, nor known him.</hi> He hath not anointed his eyes with this <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> that he might ſee; nor ſeen with his eyes as thus anointed: <hi>He that doth evil, hath not ſeen God,</hi> 1 John 3. 6, 8. 3 John 11. He that ſeeth, and abideth in the ſight of, the end wherefore he was manifeſted, to wit, to take away our ſins; and of his faithfulneſs therein; <hi>for in him is no ſin:</hi> he that beholdeth and conſidereth the bitter Cup Chriſt drank off, and the ſhameful, cruel, accurſed death he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our ſins, who was the Son of God, to the end he might redeem us from all iniquity; and what a Fountain he is become, in whom is all forgiveneſs, righteouſneſs, reſt, refreſhing, waſhing and cleanſing, eternal life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such an one is preſerved from ſowing to, and ſiding with that ſin that dwelleth in him; he getteth an eſcape, and fleeth from <hi>the pollutions of the world, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.
20. So much the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> alſo ſignifieth, when he ſaith,
<hi>Whoſe looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth, he being not a forgetful hearer of the word, but a doer of the works, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> The man that continueth looking in this Glaſs, this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus, is a doer; he <hi>layeth apart all filthineſs, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103338:139"/> ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> as it is diſcovered, and made to ſwim aloft, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21-25. This truth known ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him free from the bondage and ſlavery of his ſins,
<hi>John</hi> 8. 31-33. And he is made willing by theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments contained in the Goſpel, to ſell and part with his iniquities and abominations,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1-3. And ſo alſo, in beholding Chriſt crucified, and looking upon the Croſs of Chriſt which he hath endured and overcome, and the glory which there-thorow he hath received, a man may be broken off from his idols. The world (the wiſdom, righteouſneſs, riches, honour, glory, pomp, and ſplendour, favour and friendſhip, cuſtoms and faſhions of the world) is crucified unto ſuch an one as is thus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed through the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. So as he keepeth himſelf from thoſe idols, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20, 21. Thus when the Apoſtles preached Chriſt to men, and he was received, and beheld in his Goſpel by them, they then turned to God from their idols; <hi>and were waſhed, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Theſ. 1. 5-9. and 2: 13. 1 Cor. 6. 9-11. and 12. 2. with Chap. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. The ſeeing our ſins and idols in this teſtimony, will make us willing to ſell them, and part with them, that we may have and enjoy this Gold and White Raiment.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the beholding and ſeeing in, and with this
<hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> what a ſad condition we are in without Chriſt, and without this durable riches and righteouſneſs here preſented to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is a powerful argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and move us <hi>to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, that we may win him, and be found in him, and be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of him, in whom there is bleſsing prepared for all the kindreds of the earth,</hi> Acts 3. 25. The ſeeing and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that without him we are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and naked, and undone creatures; and that abig
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103338:140"/> ding ſuch, we ſhall be ſpued out of his mouth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſerable for ever; for nothing beſides him will ſecure from evil, and ſatisfie us with good. This is a forcible motive and argument to move us to be hot and fervent in Spirit, that we may buy of him thoſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Treaſures here counſelled unto, which only will render us bleſſed and happy in the enjoyment of them: As it appeareth here in this place, the ſcope of it being conſidered by us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
15-19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is alſo needful for us to <hi>anoint our eyes with this Eye-ſalve, that we may ſee;</hi> becauſe not onely are there ſuch powerful arguments propoſed to, and ſet before us in this teſtimony of Chriſt, to move us, and make us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to buy: But alſo there is a mighty and ſupernatural power put forth in, and with theſe arguments in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to convert us, <hi>and to turn us from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; and ſo from our ſins and idols unto the living and true God,</hi> Acts 26. 18-23. The Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God; his arm and power is put forth therein to effect in us what he requireth of us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18-23, 24. His hand and mighty power is ſtretched forth herein all the day long, to enable us to turn to him in and at his reproofs; and to caſt away our ſins and abominations out of his ſight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20-24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1-3. <hi>Rom.</hi>

<hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. In looking unto Chriſt, beholding and minding what he hath done for us, and is become, and what is treaſured up for us in him; and therein ſeeing our ſins and idols, and in how ſad a condition we are without him; God is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us from our iniquities and vanities, and enabling us to run from them to Chriſt.

God in and by his Spirit is ſo preſent in and with this Goſpel of Chriſt, that he that receiveth that, receiveth Chriſt, and him who ſent him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.

<hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 51. The hand of the Lord is put forth in, and preſent with the arguments of the glorious Goſpel, to convert and turn us from our evils and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto Chriſt, and to make us willing, who naturally are without an heart, and unwilling to gain and buy Chriſt, and the unſearchable riches of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 20, 21. &amp; 3. 13-19. It therefore evidently appeareth,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103338:141"/> that it is very needful for us to <hi>anoint our eyes with this Eye-ſalve, that we may ſee.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="3">3. And on the other hand, it is needful for us to <hi>anoint our eyes with this Eye-ſalve,</hi> that we may in ſeeing ſee the excellency of Chriſt, and vileneſs, and unprofitableneſs of all other things, to the end we may part with them for him; or otherwiſe we ſhall be, and abide under the power of Satan, as hath been alſo before ſaid. He hath his power in darkneſs; and while men remain blind, he can deceive them, and lead them captive at his pleaſure, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. Hence it is ſaid, thoſe evil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers are the rulers of the darkneſs of this world; he ruleth and prevaileth over them who remain in blindneſs and darkneſs, and ſerveth himſelf of them, making them do his luſts and requirings, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 12. He ſo blindeth the minds of them that believe not, that anoint not their eyes with this
<hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> that the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, may not ſhine unto them; that they may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his excellency and comelineſs. And together here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo, he commendeth, and rendreth excellent, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and pleaſurable the things which indeed are vile, evil, and abominable; For he is the God of this world, of ſuch as are, and remain in ignorance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. He prevailingly perſwadeth them, that the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, are moſt deſireable, and worthy to be earneſtly ſought after, and affectionately embraced by us; and that no fruit is ſo good and pleaſant, and worthy to be ſed on by us, as that which is forbidden us of God: For as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> through his ſubtilty at firſt, ſo he is alſo endeavouring to deceive us, and to corrupt from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
1-3. And what may he not perſwade thoſe that are in ignorance to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103338:141"/> do? And whither may he not lead them? Through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance he prevailed with the Jews, to prefer a murderer before the Prince of life; and at laſt to kill him with wicked hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
14, 15, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. Through ignorance <hi>Saul</hi> was a Perſecutour, blaſphemer, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and verily thought he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>Through ignorance men worſhip ſtocks, and ſtones, and prefer vain things before Chriſt, and thoſe durable and moſt excellent treaſures hid in him; and are enemies unto, and haters of him, and of thoſe that call upon his name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 17-20. &amp; 45. 20-22.

Yea, not to inlarge hereto, while men are blind, they are in a condition to ſleight Chriſt, and to follow all that is evil, according to their proper inclination, and to prefer their ſins and idols before him. When the Apoſtle giveth us an account of the ſadneſs of the condition of himſelf and others, before the Grace of God was received by them, he firſt telleth us, they were fooliſh, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. As intimating to us, that that leadeth to all that is evil. This was doubtleſs a great cauſe of the evil found with this Angel and Church, of undervaluing Chriſt, and preferring other things before him, to wit, their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they had in a great meaſure loſt, or let go the knowledge and ſight of Chriſt, and of all other things as diſcovered in him, which ſometimes they had had.—All which ſhew unto us, in ſome meaſure, why it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to

To ſhew unto us the great evil, and ſad judgment of them who endeavour to bring men into, and keep them in blindneſs and ignorance; theſe are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded after the example of our Lord Jeſus, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth the blind to <hi>anoint their eyes, that they may ſee;</hi> nor like the Apoſtles, who inſtructed the Believers, <hi>to adde to their faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge; and to grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 6, &amp; 3. 18. and endeavoured their helpfulneſs hereto: But they are rather like to thoſe thieves ſpoken of, againſt whom the Lord was, and is, who did <hi>ſteal away his word every one from his neighbour,</hi> Jer. 23. 29,
30. Or like unto them unto whom our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Wo unto you Lawyers; For ye have taken away the key of knowledge: Ye entred not in your ſelves; and them that were entring in, Ye hindred,</hi> Luke 11. 52. They ſerve Satan's deſign, and do his luſts.—</p>
            <p n="2">2.

When the Believers to whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth, were in darkneſs, they then walked in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, luſts, exceſs of wine, revellings, banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and abominable idolatries,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 10. with Chapter 4. 3, 4.—</p>
            <p n="3">3. And let it exhort us all to cry after knowledge, and to lift up our voice for underſtanding, and to apply our eyes to Gods teſtimony, and not let that depart from them, that we may look to Chriſt that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and our faces may not be aſhamed, <hi>Prov.</hi>
